module Common_arrays_C
!
!  This module contains all the arrays relating to the system being calculated.
!  Every entry is unique, and has the same meaning in every subroutine.
!
!
!  This module can also be regarded as a dictionary of the arrays relating to the system.
!  Quantities which have only a one-line descriptionis are of no interest outside MOPAC.
!  The data-type for each quantity is given at the start of the statement
