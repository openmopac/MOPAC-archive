<H1>Error messages produced by MOPAC </H1>
<P>&nbsp;MOPAC produces several hundred messages, all of which are intended to be self-explanatory. However, when an error occurs it is useful to have more information than is given in the standard messages. </P>
<P>The following alphabetical list gives more complete definitions of the messages printed. </P>
<B><TT><DL>
<DT>1SCF SPECIFIED WITH PATH. ...</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
The pair of options, <TT>1SCF</TT> with a path calculation, is not allowed, except in a <TT>RESTART</TT> calculation. <A NAME="BM34608">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34609">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>A SINGLE ATOM HAS NO VIBRATIONAL MODES</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
An attempt has been made to calculate the vibrations of a single atom. The smallest system that can have vibrations is a diatomic molecule. <A NAME="BM34611">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34612">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34613">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34614">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>A SYMMETRY FUNCTION IS USED TO DEFINE A NON-EXISTENT ATOM</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
Symmetry functions can only be used in the definition of atoms or dummy atoms. Check the dependent atom numbers in the symmetry data. <A NAME="BM34616">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34617">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34618">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34619">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>ALL CONVERGERS ARE NOW FORCED ON</B></TT> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
The default SCF convergers have not worked. A new set of convergers will be tried. This is often caused by faulty data, so the data should be checked to see if anything is wrong. This sometimes happens naturally, particularly with exotic systems. <A NAME="BM34621">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO PRINT...</B></TT> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
To avoid printing very large matrices in MOZYME, an upper limit (200) has been set on the size of matrix that can be printed. If the array requested is larger than this limit, only part of the array will be printed. <A NAME="BM34623">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>AN UNOPTIMIZABLE GEOMETRIC PARAMETER ...</B></TT> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
When internal coordinates are supplied, six coordinates cannot be optimized. These are the three coordinates of atom 1, the angle and dihedral on atom 2 and the dihedral on atom 3. An attempt has been made to optimize one of these. This is usually indicative of a typographic error, but might simply be an oversight. Either way, the error will be corrected and the calculation will not be stopped here. <A NAME="BM34625">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34626">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34627">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34628">&nbsp;</A> </DD>

<B><TT><DT>AT LEAST ONE ATOM DEFINED BY CVB...</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
The atoms defined in <TT>CVD</TT> are limited to the real atoms. If any dummy atoms are used, these should <EM>not</EM> be included in the atom numbering used. <A NAME="BM34642">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34643">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>AT LEAST ONE ATOM HAS A ZERO MASS</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
In a <TT>FORCE</TT> calculation, the mass of an atom is zero. To correct this, <A HREF="node347.html#atom_mass">give the mass explicitly</A>. <A NAME="BM34650">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34651">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>At this point, both reactants ...</B></TT> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
In a <TT>SADDLE</TT> calculation, both reactants and products are on the same side of the transition state. Options at this point are: <A NAME="BM34654">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<DD>If it is near to the transition state (the gradient norm has been dropping for reactants or products, or the "DISTANCE A-B" is small, e.g. less than 0.2), refine the geometry using <TT>TS</TT>. </DD>
<DD>If it is not near to the transition state, identify geometries on both sides of the transition state (these will be separated in the output by the message "REACTANTS AND PRODUCTS SWAPPED AROUND"), and use these to start a new <TT>SADDLE</TT> calculation. Add <TT>BAR=0.02</TT>. </DD>
<DD>If CPU time is not important, add <TT>BAR=0.02</TT> to the original data set and re-run. </DD>
<B><TT><DT>Atom <I>nn</I> is Cartesian...</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
An attempt has been made to use symmetry function 19 (the bond length is a multiple of the reference bond length) using an atom whose position is defined using Cartesian coordinates. Correct the error and re-run. <A NAME="BM34662">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34663">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>Atom <I>nn</I> is internal...</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
An attempt has been made to use symmetry function 18 (the "<I>z</I>" coordinate is set equal to minus the reference "<I>y</I>" coordinate) using an atom whose position is defined using internal coordinates. Correct the error and re-run. <A NAME="BM34665">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34666">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>ATOM NUMBER <I>nn</I> IS ILLDEFINED</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
The rules for definition of atom connectivity are: <A NAME="BM34668">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34669">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<DT>1. Atom 1 has no connectivity. </DT>
<DT>2. Atom 2 can be Cartesian or internal. If internal, it must be defined with connectivity (1,0,0). </DT>
<DT>3. Atom 3 can be Cartesian or internal. If internal, it must be defined with connectivity (2,1,0) or (1,2,0). </DT>
<DT>4. All other atoms can be Cartesian or internal. If internal, they must be defined in terms of already-defined atoms: these atoms must all be different. Thus atom 9 might be connected to atom 5, make an angle with atom 6, and have a dihedral with atom 7. If the dihedral was with atom 5, then the geometry definition would be faulty. </DT>
</DL>
<P>If any of these rules is broken, a fatal error message is printed, and the calculation stopped. </P>
<B><TT><DL>
<DT>ATOMIC MASS OF ATOM <I>nn</I> TOO SMALL</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
In a <TT>DRC</TT> calculation, all atoms must have masses greater than 0.1 times the mass of a hydrogen atom. If sparkles are used, these have no default mass. Atom masses are specified as numbers after the symbol, e.g. H1.008 or +12.00 (for a "+" sparkle having a mass of 12.00.) <A NAME="BM34674">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34675">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>ATOMIC NUMBER <I>nn</I> IS NOT AVAILABLE ...</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
An element has been used for which parameters are not available. Only if a typographic error has been made can this be rectified. This check is not exhaustive, in that even if the elements are acceptable there are some combinations of elements within MINDO/3 that are not allowed. This is a fatal error message. <A NAME="BM34678">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34679">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>ATOMIC NUMBER OF <I>nn</I> ?</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
An atom has been specified with a negative or zero atomic number. This is normally caused by forgetting to specify an atomic number or symbol. This is a fatal error message. <A NAME="BM34681">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34682">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>ATOMS <I>nn</I> AND <I>nn</I> ARE SEPARATED BY nn.nnnn ANGSTROMS</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
Two genuine atoms (not dummies) are separated by a very small distance. This can occur when a complicated geometry is being optimized, in which case the user may wish to continue. This can be done by using the keyword <TT>GEO-OK</TT>. More often, however, this message indicates a mistake, and the calculation is, by default, stopped. <A NAME="BM34685">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34686">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>ATTEMPT TO GO DOWNHILL IS UNSUCCESSFUL ...</B></TT> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
A quite rare message, produced by Bartel's gradient<A NAME="BM34688">&nbsp;</A> norm minimization. Bartel's method attempts to minimize the gradient norm by searching the gradient space for a minimum. Apparently a minimum has been found, but not recognized as such. The program has searched in all 3<I>N</I>-6 directions, and found no way down, but the criteria for a minimum have not been satisfied. No advice is available for getting round this error. <A NAME="BM34689">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34690">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>AVAILABLE MEMORY IN GREENS FUNCTION TOO SMALL</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
This error is caused by a program bug. Please make a report to Dr.&nbsp;Stewart. <A NAME="BM34692">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34693">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>BOTH GEOMETRIES ARE IDENTICAL</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
The <TT>SADDLE</TT> technique uses two geometries, one for the reactant(s) and one for the product(s). These must be different. Correct fault and re-run. <A NAME="BM34696">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34697">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>BOTH SYSTEMS ARE ON THE SAME SIDE ...</B></TT> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
A non-fatal message, but still cause for concern. During a SADDLE calculation the two geometries involved are on opposite sides of the transition state. This situation is verified at every point by calculating the cosine of the angle between the two gradient vectors. For as long as it is negative, then the two geometries are on opposite sides of the TS. If, however, the cosine becomes positive, then the assumption is made that one moiety has fallen over the TS and is now below the other geometry. That is, it is now further from the TS than the other, temporarily fixed, geometry. To correct this, identify geometries corresponding to points on each side of the TS. (Two geometries on the output separated by the message <TT>"SWAPPING..."</TT>) and make up a new data-file using these geometries. This corresponds to points on the reaction path near to the TS. Run a new job using these two geometries, but with <TT>BAR<A NAME="BM34701"></TT>&nbsp;</A> set to a third or a quarter of its original value, e.g. <TT>BAR=0.05</TT>. This normally allows the TS to be located. <A NAME="BM34703">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34704">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>C.I. IS OF SIZE LESS THAN ROOT SPECIFIED</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
The value of <I>n</I> in <TT>ROOT=<I>n</I></TT> is less than the size of the C.I. </DD>

<B><TT><DT>C.I. NOT ALLOWED WITH UHF</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
There is no UHF configuration interaction calculation in MOPAC. Either remove the keyword that implies C.I. or the word UHF. <A NAME="BM34713">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34714">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>CALCULATION ABANDONED AT THIS POINT</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
A particularly annoying message! In order to define an atom's position, the three atoms used in the connectivity table must not accidentally fall into a straight line. This can happen during a geometry optimization or gradient minimization. If they do, and if the angle made by the atom being defined is not zero or 180 degrees, then its position becomes ill-defined. This is not desirable, and the calculation will stop in order to allow corrective action to be taken. Note that if the three atoms are in an exactly straight line, this message will not be triggered. <A NAME="BM34716">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34717">&nbsp;</A> </DD>

<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
<TT>XYZ</TT> is not allowed when geometries are specified using GAUSSIAN format. To allow <TT>XYZ</TT> to be used, first do a <TT>0SCF</TT> calculation to convert GAUSSIAN format geometry into the MOPAC format. <A NAME="BM34728">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34729">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>CHARGE ON ATOM <I>N</I> UNREASONABLE</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
The range of allowed charges for an atom is limited. Allowed charges are: Group I: +1; II: +1, +2; III: +1, +2, +3; IV: -1, +1; V: +1; VI: -1, -2; VII: -1. Any charges outside these ranges are considered unreasonable. <A NAME="BM34731">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34732">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<DD>Correct the geometry and re-run. </DD>
<B><TT><DT>Connectivity of atom <I>NN</I>...</B></TT> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
The rules for definition of atom connectivity are: <A NAME="BM34734">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34735">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<DT>1. Atom 1 has no connectivity. </DT>
<DT>2. Atom 2 can be Cartesian or internal. If internal, it must be defined with connectivity (1,0,0). </DT>
<DT>3. Atom 3 can be Cartesian or internal. If internal, it must be defined with connectivity (2,1,0) or (1,2,0). </DT>
<DT>4. All other atoms can be Cartesian or internal. If internal, they must be defined in terms of already-defined atoms: these atoms must all be different. Thus atom 9 might be connected to atom 5, make an angle with atom 6, and have a dihedral with atom 7. If the dihedral was with atom 5, then the geometry definition would be faulty. </DT>
</DL>
<P>If any of these rules is broken, a fatal error message is printed, and the calculation stopped. </P>
<B><TT><DL>
<DT>COORDINATES MUST BE CARTESIAN</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
In a <TT>DRC</TT> calculation, in which an initial velocity is to be used, the geometry must be supplied in Cartesian coordinates, in order for the velocity to be meaningful. If it is essential that internal coordinates be used for the geometry, add <TT>LET</TT>, and re-run. The velocity vector, however, must still be in Cartesian coordinates. <A NAME="BM34741">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34742">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>CROSS requires ROOT=2 or higher</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
In an intersystem crossing calculation, the crossing is defined in terms of the higher energy state. Because of this, <TT>ROOT=<I>n</I></TT> <EM>must</EM> be used, and <I>n</I> <TT>must</TT> be more than 1. <A NAME="BM34747">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM34748">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>CUTOF1 WAS SET SMALLER THAN CUTOF2</B></TT> </DT>

<DD>To date three unconditional convergers have appeared in the literature: the <TT>SHIFT<A NAME="BM34905"></TT>&nbsp;</A> technique, Pulay's method, and the Camp-King converger.

The 20 common amino acid residues are automatically identified. Other residues can be made known to MOPAC by use of the keyword <TT>XENO=<I>text</I></TT>. The numbers printed after this message are the numbers of C, N, O, and S atoms found in the residue. <A NAME="BM35588">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM35589">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<DD>Inspect the residue, and identify which of the 20 common residues it is related to. In <TT>XENO</TT> specify the number of extra atoms needed to make up the numbers in the unknown residue. Re-run the calculation. </DD>

<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
In the geometric specification a chemical symbol which does not correspond to any known element has been used. The error lies in the first datum on a line of geometric data. <A NAME="BM35592">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM35593">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>UNRECOGNIZED HESS OPTION</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
The allowed values for <I>n</I> in <TT>HESS=<I>n</I></TT> are 0, 1, and 2. Correct the keyword and re-run. <A NAME="BM35596">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM35597">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>UNRECOGNIZED KEY-WORDS.</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
Check these keywords. Correct any misspellings and re-run, or, if the keywords are DEBUG keywords, add <TT>DEBUG</TT> and re-run. <A NAME="BM35600">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM35601">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>UNRECOGNIZED SPECIES: <I>text</B></I></TT> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
While reading a PDB file, an unrecognized chemical symbol has been used. Recognized symbols are those for any element that can be handled by MOPAC, and the symbols 'X' (for hydrogen) and 'L' (for a lone pair). <A NAME="BM35603">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<DD>The job will not be stopped by this error message, but the <I>text</I> should be examined to see if it is a real element, but with an unconventional symbol. If it is, add <TT>PDB(<I>code</I>)</TT>, where <I>code</I> <A HREF="node257.html#key_pdb">is defined elsewhere</A> . Even if <I>text</I> does not apply to an element, <TT>PDB(<I>code</I>)</TT> can still be used, but set the atomic number to zero. This will prevent the error message from recurring. </DD>
<B><TT><DT>UPPER BOUND OF ACTIVE SPACE IS GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF ORBITALS</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
The keywords used here imply a system that is larger than that used. Correct data set (probably by changing the keywords) and re-run. <A NAME="BM35611">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM35612">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>Use AIGIN to allow more geometries to be used</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
Only one GAUSSIAN geometry is allowed in a run, unless each GAUSSIAN geometry is identified by <TT>AIGIN</TT> on the keyword line. Add <TT>AIGIN</TT> to each GAUSSIAN geometry keyword line, and re-run. <A NAME="BM35616">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM35617">&nbsp;</A> </DD>

MOPAC can be compiled so as to either minimize memory demand or to maximize reliability. Depending on which option was used, the alternative option can be selected at run time by using <A HREF="node296.html#safe"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><TT>SAFE</U></FONT></TT></A> or <A HREF="node336.html#unsafe"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><TT>UNSAFE</U></FONT></TT></A>. </DD>

In the <TT>ESP</TT> method, van der Waals radii are used. Only the following elements are allowed: H, B, C, N, O, F, P, S, Cl, Br, I. <A NAME="BM35630">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM35631">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<DD>In the <TT>PMEP</TT> method, van der Waals radii are also used. Only the elements up to <I>Z</I>=17 and bromine are allowed. </DD>
<B><TT><DT>VECPRT CAN ONLY PRINT ARRAYS OF SIZE .LT. 200</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
To minimize output, the size of arrays that can be printed in a MOZYME calculation is limited to 200. Bigger arrays are truncated so that only the sub-array of size 200 is printed. If larger arrays are to be printed, edit "vecprt.F" to change <TT>MAXARR</TT> to the desired value, re-run "make", and re-run the job. <A NAME="BM35635">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>VIRTUAL C VECTOR DAMAGED IN SELMOS</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
In a MOZYME calculation, when <TT>RAPID</TT> is used (in a partial geometry optimization), the virtual M.O. coefficients were found to be corrupt. Please inform Dr&nbsp;Stewart as soon as possible. <A NAME="BM35638">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM35639">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>VIRTUAL IC VECTOR DAMAGED IN SELMOS</B></TT><STRONG> (FATAL)</STRONG> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
In a MOZYME calculation, when <TT>RAPID</TT> is used (in a partial geometry optimization), the list of atoms in the virtual M.O. was found to be corrupt. Please inform Dr&nbsp;Stewart as soon as possible. <A NAME="BM35642">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM35643">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>WARNING - GEOMETRY IS NOT AT A STATIONARY POINT</B></TT> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
Under certain circumstances the gradient norm can drop to zero, but the derivatives of the energy with respect to Cartesian coordinates might be quite large. If this happens, this error message will be printed. <A NAME="BM35645">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM35646">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<DD>To avoid this message, make sure that the geometry can be optimized, given the optimization flags you have chosen. In particular, if (3<I>N</I>-6) optimization flags are set, and there are no dummy atoms, then it is unlikely that this message will be generated. </DD>
<B><TT><DT>WARNING - SPARKLES ARE NOT TREATED CORRECTLY</B></TT> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
When <TT>ENPART</TT> is used on a system involving sparkles, the energy terms due to the sparkles are not printed correctly. <A NAME="BM35649">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>WARNING </DT>
</B></TT><DD>&nbsp; <BR>
Don't pay too much attention to this message. Thermodynamics calculations require a higher precision than vibrational frequency calculations. In particular, the gradient norm should be very small. However, it is frequently not practical to reduce the gradient norm further, and to date no-one has determined just how slack the gradient criterion can be before unacceptable errors appear in the thermodynamic quantities. The 0.4 gradient norm is only a suggestion. <A NAME="BM35651">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM35652">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
<B><TT><DT>WARNING! NO BACKBONE ATOMS IDENTIFIED</B></TT> </DT>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR>
When <TT>NEWGEO</TT> is used to generate a mixed coordinate <I>Z</I>-matrix for a protein, this message will be generated if no backbone atoms (the -NH-CH-CO- of a peptide) are found. Check that at least one "CO-NH" linkage exists. <A NAME="BM35655">&nbsp;</A> <A NAME="BM35656">&nbsp;</A> </DD>
