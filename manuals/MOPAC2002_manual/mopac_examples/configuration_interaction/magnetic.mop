**  An exercise in angular momentum.**  Hexafluorobenzene, in the +1 ionized form, has 3 electrons in the highest*  filled pi orbital.  Using a large C.I., the following calculations can be*  run:**  1.  Magnetic component of spin, Ms=3/2. *      This gives quartet and sextet states only.  Of these, state 17, a A2u state*      is selected.  From group theory, only transitions to quartet E1g are allowed.**  2.  Ms=1/2.  Now doublet states are added.  The quartet E1g state is now state 45**  3.  Ms=-1/2. By time-reversal (Kramer's degeneracy) this will give the same *      result at the previous calculation.**  4.  Ms=-3/2. Again, by time-reversal, the results are the same as *      for calculation 1.**  5.  Ms=5/2.  This magnetic state does NOT include quartets, but *      does include sextets.  Verify that the sextet state energies are *      unchanged across all spin states.*      *   More output:**    LARGE   - Print state vectors (use carefully - for Ms=+/- 1/2 there *              are MANY states)*    VECTORS - Print M.O.s in the region of the HOMO-LUMO gap.*    ALLVECS - If VECTORS is also present, print all the M.O.s.*    SYMOIR  - Print the working in the symmetry analysis. *ROOT=17  CHARGE=1 OPEN(3,2) MS=1.5 C.I.=6 MECI NOINTER NOXYZ VECTORS  &SYMMETRY 1SCF Vectors ALLVecs Hexafluorobenzene  C    0.000000  0    .000000  0    0.000000  0                    0.1472  C    1.485354  1   0.000000  0    0.000000  0     1              0.1472  C    1.485354  0 120.000000  0    0.000000  0     2     1        0.1472  C    1.485354  0 120.000000  0    0.000000  0     3     2     1  0.1472  C    1.485354  0 120.000000  0    0.000000  0     4     3     2  0.1472  C    1.485354  0 120.000000  0    0.000000  0     5     4     3  0.1472  F    1.291030  1 120.000000  0  180.000000  0     1     6     5  0.0194  F    1.291030  0 120.000000  0  180.000000  0     5     6     1  0.0194  F    1.291030  0 120.000000  0  180.000000  0     2     1     6  0.0194  F    1.291030  0 120.000000  0  180.000000  0     6     1     2  0.0194  F    1.291030  0 120.000000  0  180.000000  0     3     2     1  0.0194  F    1.291030  0 120.000000  0  180.000000  0     4     3     2  0.0194    2  1    3    4    5    6   7  1    8    9   10   11   12Oldgeo ROOT=45  CHARGE=1 OPEN(3,2) MS=0.5 C.I.=6 MECI NOINTER &NOXYZ 1SCFOldgeo ROOT=45  CHARGE=1 OPEN(3,2) MS=-0.5 C.I.=6 MECI NOINTER &NOXYZ 1SCFOldgeo ROOT=17  CHARGE=1 OPEN(3,2) MS=-1.5 C.I.=6 MECI NOINTER &NOXYZ 1SCF SYMOIROldgeo CHARGE=1 OPEN(3,2) MS=2.5 C.I.=6 MECI NOINTER &NOXYZ 1SCF large
