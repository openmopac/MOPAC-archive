A SADDLE calculation*   is run.  Note that although the order of the atoms in the two systms MUST*   be the same, the connectivity can be different,* **  The geometry resulting from this run is close to the final transition state.*  To reach the transition state, the geometry can be refined using TS.  *   TS               OLDGEO   SADDLE CALCULATION, CH2O - HCOH **  And finally, the transition state can be verified by a FORCE calculation:*   FORCE OLDGEO   SADDLE CALCULATION, CH2O - HCOH
