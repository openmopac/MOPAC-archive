EXTERNAL=h_to_s sets all the beta-s and beta-p values to*  1.0.  This has the effect of converting the two-center terms in the H matrix*  into overlaps.  Unfortunately, there is no easy way to set the one-center terms*  to 1.0 and 0.0.  This needs to be done "by hand".** The charge is set very large in order to remove all electrons - this prevents* the SCF being run.** If 1SCF is NOT used, the system would change shape...** HCORE is necessary for printing the H matrix.*
