MOPAC Manual. This this document first.
===========================================


This is an  HTML version of the MOPAC Manual written by
J. J. P Stewart, revision May 1999.

The HTML was converted from the LateX source by  Christopher S. Page
using LaTeX2HTML 98.1 and indexed, using software from www.jobjects.com,
by Henry S. Rzepa and G. Gkoutos.

Viewing the HTML:  You will need a  World-Wide Web Browser capable of 
supporting  frames, Java and JavaScript.  Netscape 4.0, 4.5 and  4.6, 
Internet Explorer 4.0 and 5.0 and iCab 1.6 (Macintosh only) have been tested.

Printing pages from the manual:  All the equations have been converted from
the original  TeX markup to  GIF images, which are displayed at half size
in the browser window. The "half-size" dithering is handled differently
by different browsers, and with different results. We find that Internet
Explorer produces a better on-screen and printed appearance than
Netscape, and recommend this browser for printing individual pages.
Alternatively, if you wish to acquire or print individual GIF images,
then using the right hand mouse button (or extended mouse press on
Macintosh) you can invoke the "open this image" or "save this image as"
options to display the full size image, and if necessary print the
images at the original size. 

Searching the CDROM: A Java-based search engine is available for
keyword searching. Only HTML text files and  .mop MOPAC input files
have been indexed. Two different kinds of search are possible;
a) simple  keyword searches with the document containing the search
term displayed in a Browser window.  The search term is not highlighted
and if multiple occurances exist, each must be found using the
Find facility provided within the  Browser. b) A search term
highlighting window, where the search keyword is highlighted in
red within the browser window, along with a small navigation 
symbol for finding the previous or next occurance of the search
term.

Java and JavaScript Support:  These are used by the Jobject search
engine. We find the behaviour in different browsers, and indeed in
different versions of browsers can vary. To our knowledge, Netscape
Communicator 4.5 and  4.6 and Internet  Explorer  5 
fully support all the options. Earlier versions of these 
browsers may not always function correctly.

Browser Plug-ins: The manual contains hypertext links to 
MOPAC input datasets. If you have configured the  MIME type
chemical/x-mopac-input in your browser, you can view these
datasets using an appropriate program or plug-in, instead
of displaying them as text files.  Two specific plugins
are available which can process  such  MOPAC files.

1. Chime, from MDL. Visit  http://www.mdli.com/ for
further details

2. Chem3D Std or Net Plugin. Visit http://www.camsoft.com/
for further details.


Errors:  The process of converting from LaTeX to  HTML is not
error-free. Whlst we have endeavoured to correct any such
errors, somemay remain.  Please report any you may find at
the email address given below.
