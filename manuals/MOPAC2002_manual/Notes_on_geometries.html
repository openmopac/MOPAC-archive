<P>Reference geometry data are taken from many sources, mainly from X-ray and microwave structures. No differentiation is made between these various sources, although microwave structures are preferred to X-ray. Further, no differentiation is made between various definitions of bond lengths. Thus the bond length corresponding to the bottom of the harmonic well, <I>r<SUB>o</I></SUB>, is not distinguished from the equilibrium bond length, or from the bond length corresponding to the system in which the zero point energy is included. For semiempirical methods, the average error in bond lengths is large relative to the differences between the bond lengths obtained using the various definitions. </P>
