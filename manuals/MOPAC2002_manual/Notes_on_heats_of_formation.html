<P>All heats of formation were calculated using the data set in the hyperlink for the name of the compound.&nbsp; 
For most systems, the &quot;heat of formation&quot; is the negative of the heat, in 
kcal/mol, released when one mole of the compound, at one atmosphere in the gas 
phase at 298K, is formed from its elements in their standard state.&nbsp; Thus, 
for benzene, the experimental heat of formation is 19.81 kcal/mol.&nbsp; This 
means that in order to form one mole of benzene vapor (78g)&nbsp; at 1 
atmosphere at 298K, from three moles of hydrogen (6g) and 6 gram-moles of 
graphite (72g of graphite), 19.81 kcal of energy must be absorbed. </P>
<P>For many systems, of which the alkali metal compounds are typical, the heat 
of formation is not readily available, and the heat of reaction is used instead.&nbsp; 
Systems of this type can be identified from the data-sets: they will contain 
expressions of the form &quot;H=const+reactant1+reactant2&quot;, to indicate that the heat 
of reaction involves reactants &quot;reactant1&quot; and &quot;reactant2&quot;.&nbsp; For example, 
for the complex of&nbsp; sodium cation with ammonia, the energy is defined as&nbsp; 
&quot;H=-25.4+NA_CAT+NH3&quot;</P>
<P>Where very weak interactions are involved, the heat absorbed by the change is 
used, thus for water dimer, the heat of dimerization is relative to the heat of 
formation of the two isolated water molecules.&nbsp; Similarly, the heat of a 
conformer would be defined relative to another, usually the more stable, 
conformer.</P>
