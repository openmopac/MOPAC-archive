<TT>TS</TT> </h1>
<P>Within the Eigenvector Following routine&nbsp;[<A HREF="references.html#ef-ts">7</A>], the option exists to optimize a transition state. To do this, use <TT>TS</TT>. Preliminary indications are that the TS method is much faster and more reliable than either <A HREF="sigma.html"><tt>SIGMA</tt></A> or <A HREF="nllsq.html"><tt>NLLSQ</tt></A>. <TT>TS</TT> appears to work well with Cartesian coordinates. In the event that <TT>TS </TT>does not converge on a stationary point, try adding <A HREF="recalc.html"><tt>RECALC=5</tt></A> to the keyword line. </P>
<P>Caution: When a transition state is optimized, and some optimization flags 
are not set for optimization, the optimized structure might have a significant 
gradient.&nbsp; This usually happens when the fixed atoms are not in their 
optimized positions.</P>
