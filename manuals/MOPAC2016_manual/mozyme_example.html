Simple MOZYME example</B></h1>
<p align="left">
MOZYME is a method for speeding up the process of solving the SCF equations.&nbsp; 
It does not affect any geometric processes.&nbsp; To use the MOZYME function, 
add keyword MOZYME to the data set.&nbsp; As an example, look at the data set 
for the geometry optimization of formic acid:<p align="left">
Data-set: <PRE><b> MOZYME
Optimize the geometry of formic acid 

   O    0.0  0    0.0 0    0.0 0   0  0  0
   C    1.20 1    0.0 0    0.0 0   0  0  0
   O    1.32 1  116.8 1    0.0 0   2  1  0
   H    0.98 1  123.9 1    0.0 0   3  2  1
   H    1.11 1  127.3 1  180.0 0   2  1  3    
</b></PRE>
The difference between the output from a conventional matrix-algebra method and 
the Localized Molecular Orbital method can be easily seen by comparing the 
output of MOPAC calculations in which the keyword MOZYME is present and when it 
is not present. The main difference is the absence of ionization potentials in 
the MOZYME calculation: these are functions of eigenvectors and MOZYME does not 
generate eigenvectors, only molecular orbitals.<p>&nbsp;</p>
