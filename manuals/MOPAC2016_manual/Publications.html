		Abstract</h3>
<p class="gs_rt">An accurate model of three-dimensional protein structure is 
important in a variety of fields such as structure-based drug design and 
mechanistic studies of enzymatic reactions. While the entries in the Protein 
Data Bank (<span class="ExternalRef"><a target="_parent" href="http://www.pdb.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="RefSource">http://www.pdb.org</span></a></span>) 
provide valuable information about protein structures, a small fraction of the 
PDB structures were found to contain anomalies not reported in the PDB file. The 
semiempirical PM7 method in MOPAC2012 was used for identifying anomalously short 
hydrogen bonds, C–H<sup>&hellip;</sup>O/C–H<sup>&hellip;</sup>N interactions, 
non-bonding close contacts, and unrealistic covalent bond lengths in recently 
published Protein Data Bank files. It was also used to generate new structures 
with these faults removed. When the semiempirical models were compared to those 
of PDB_REDO (<span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/pdb_redo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="RefSource">http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/pdb_redo/</span></a></span>), 
the clashscores, as defined by MolProbity (<span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="RefSource">http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/</span></a></span>), 
were better in about 50&nbsp;% of the structures. The semiempirical models also had a 
lower root-mean-square-deviation value in nearly all cases than those from 
PDB_REDO, indicative of a better conservation of the tertiary structure. 
Finally, the semiempirical models were found to have lower clashscores than the 
initial PDB file in all but one case. Because this approach maintains as much of 
the original tertiary structure as possible while improving anomalous 
interactions, it should be useful to theoreticians, experimentalists, and 
crystallographers investigating the structure and function of proteins.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Using the semiempirical method PM7, an attempt has been made to quantify the 
error in prediction of the <em>in vivo</em> structure of proteins relative to 
X-ray structures. Three important contributory factors are the experimental 
limitations of X-ray structures, the difference between the crystal and solution 
environments, and the errors due to PM7. The geometries of 19 proteins from the 
Protein Data Bank that had small <em>R</em> values, that is, high accuracy 
structures, were optimized and the resulting drop in heat of formation was 
calculated. Analysis of the changes showed that about 10% of this decrease in 
heat of formation was caused by faults in PM7, the balance being attributable to 
the X-ray structure and the difference between the crystal and solution 
environments. A previously unknown fault in PM7 was revealed during tests to 
validate the geometries generated using PM7. Clashscores generated by the 
Molprobity molecular mechanics structure validation program showed that PM7 was 
predicting unrealistically close contacts between nonbonding atoms in regions 
where the local geometry is dominated by very weak noncovalent interactions. The 
origin of this fault was traced to an underestimation of the core-core repulsion 
between atoms at distances smaller than the equilibrium distance.</p>

		Abstract</h3><p>Modern 
		computational chemistry methods provide a powerful tool for use in 
		refining the geometry of proteins determined by X-ray crystallography. 
		Specifically, computational methods can be used to correctly place 
		hydrogen atoms unresolved by this experimental method and improve bond 
		geometry accuracy. Using the semiempirical method PM7, the structure of 
		the nucleotide-sanitizing enzyme MTH1, complete with hydrolyzed

		substrate-binding site interaction. An estimate was made of the 
		strengths and weaknesses of the PM7 method for modeling proteins on

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>A new method for predicting the energy contributions to substrate binding and 
to specificity has been developed. Conventional global optimization methods do 
not permit the subtle effects responsible for these properties to be modeled 
with sufficient precision to allow confidence to be placed in the results, but 
by making simple alterations to the model, the precision of the various energies 
involved can be improved from of about ±2 kcal&#8729;mol-1 to ±0.1 kcal&#8729;mol-1. This 
technique was applied to the oxidized nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase enzyme 
MTH1. MTH1 is unusual in that the binding and reaction sites are well-separated, 
an advantage from a computational chemistry perspective that allows the 
energetics involved in docking to be modeled without the need to consider any 
issues relating to reaction mechanisms. In this study, two types of energy terms 
were investigated: the non-covalent interactions between the binding site and 
the substrate, and those responsible for discriminating between the oxidized 
nucleotide 8-oxo-dGTP and the normal dGTP. Both of these were investigated using 
the semiempirical method PM7 in the program MOPAC. Individual contributions from 
each residue to both the binding energy and the specificity of MTH1 were 
calculated by simulating the effect of mutations. Where comparisons were 
possible, all calculated results were in agreement with experimental 
observations. This technique provides a new insight into the binding mechanism 
that enzymes use for discriminating between possible substrates.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-language:EN-US">Three features within

the reaction site itself, where covalent bonds were made and broken, the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-language:EN-US">With one minor

relatively straightforward, leads to the recommendation that PM7 and similar

reactions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
