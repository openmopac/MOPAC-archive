	The imaginary frequency due to the reaction vector in  a
	transition state calculation must not be included in the
   thermochemical calculation.  The number of genuine vibrations
   considered can be:
	3<I>N</I>-5 for a linear ground state system, 3<I>N</I>-6 for a
	non-linear ground state system, or 3<I>N</I>-6 for a linear
	transition-state complex, 3<I>N</I>-7 for a non-linear
	transition-state complex.
<P>
This keyword must be used in conjunction with <TT>THERMO</TT> if
a transition state is being calculated.
