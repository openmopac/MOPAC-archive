<H2>Degenerate States
</H2>
By the Jahn-Teller theorem, systems with orbital degeneracy will distort so as
to remove the degeneracy.  However, many dynamic Jahn-Teller systems are known
in which the time-average geometry is of the higher point-group.  These systems
are the kind that will be addressed here. <A NAME="BM13957">&#160;</A>
<P>
The analytical RHF configuration interaction first derivative calculation
developed by Liotard&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="references.html#analci">43</A>] has been modified to allow systems with
degenerate states to be run.
<P>
Each of the degenerate states is a linear combination of microstates. Each
microstate can be described by a Slater
determinant&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="references.html#slater_det1">66</A>,<A
 HREF="references.html#slater_det2">67</A>], which represents a specific pattern
of occupancy of molecular orbitals. Each M.O. is a linear combination of
Slater atomic orbitals.
<P>
The whole state is best described by an equal
mixture of the degenerate states of which it is composed.  Note that this is
NOT a combination of states, rather it is a mixture.  An example of a
combination of  states is a state function, composed of a linear combination of
microstates.  In such a combination the phase-factor between microstates is
significant, thus state(1)=
(1/                            2)<sup>1/2</sup>(Microstate(a) + Microstate(b)) is
different from state(2)
(1/                            2)<sup>1/2</sup>(Microstate(a) - Microstate(b)).  An
example of a mixture of states is the <SUP>2</SUP>T<SUB>2<I>g</I></SUB> state of TiF<SUB>6</SUB><SUP>3-</SUP>, a
<I>d</I><SUP>1</SUP> system, in which the best description of the state is an equal mixture of
the three degenerate space components of T<SUB>2<I>g</I></SUB>, and an equal mixture of the
two spin components of the Kramer's doublet.  The overall state is thus

<P>
If equimixtures are not used, then the Jahn-Teller theorem applies, and the
system would immediately distort so as to remove the degeneracy.  In the case
of TiF<SUB>6</SUB><SUP>3-</SUP>, this would result in distortion from O<SUB><I>h</I></SUB> to D<SUB>4<I>h</I></SUB>symmetry.
