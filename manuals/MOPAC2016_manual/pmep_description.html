<H1>Parametric Molecular Electrostatic Potential (PMEP) </H1>
<P>The
<a href="pmep.html">PMEP</a> procedure&nbsp;[<A HREF="references.html#pmep1">45</A>,<A HREF="references.html#pmep2">46</A>] is a technique for rapidly calculating the electrostatic properties of a molecule. Written by Prof. George Ford and Dr. Bingze Wang* at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, the procedure is ideally suited for large systems. </P>
<P>The PMEP procedure has two main functionalities: first, to generate a 2-D grid of points giving the Electrostatic Potential (ESP) in a cross-section through a system, and second, to generate atomic charges based on the calculated ESP. At present, the method is limited to AM1 systems containing H, C, N, O, F, Cl, only. </P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION0012231000000000000000">2-D Electrostatic Potential Plots</A> </H2>
<P>ESP plots are generated in two steps. First, a MOPAC calculation generates a 2-D grid of points. This grid is then converted into a picture by the utility program <TT>ESPLOT</TT>. <TT>ESPLOT</TT> is very simple to use: the command is <TT>esplot &lt;filename&gt;</TT>, where <TT>&lt;filename&gt;</TT> is the name of the data-set. <TT>ESPLOT</TT> generates an on-line picture of the PMEP, and a HPGL file suitable for use in generating hard-copy. Because <TT>ESPLOT</TT> is so simple, it will not be discussed further. Instead, the rest of this discussion applies to the MOPAC calculation. </P>
<P>The grid generated by MOPAC consists of a 2-D array of points representing a cross-section through the system. The distance between points is a constant &Aring;ngstroms. The size represented by the grid is roughly 4 &Aring;ngstroms plus twice the size of the system. For example, N<SUB>2</SUB> has a N-N distance of &Aring;, and the default associated grid represents a rectangular area of 5.8 by 4.6 &Aring;. Each grid point represents the potential in kcal/mol which a unit positive charge would experience due to the electrostatic field of the system. </P>
<P>ESP grids are generated by specifying <A HREF="pmep.html#pmep"><TT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U>PMEP</U></FONT></TT></A> and <TT>PRTMEP</TT>. An example of a data-set for the PMEP procedure is shown in Figure 1. The PMEP plot for this data set is shown in Figure 2. This plot can be compared with the <A HREF="mep.html#mep1plot"><TT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U>MEP</U></FONT></TT> plot</A>. </P>
