<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>MOZYME is a technique that allows very large systems, in particular proteins 
and sections of DNA, to be modeled in a reasonable time.&nbsp; Although in 
principle, it is similar to conventional methods in that the underlying 
computational model is PM7 or PM6, etc., in practice there are several 
differences.&nbsp; Most of these differences are a result of the large size of 
the systems.&nbsp; In this page, some of the considerations will be discussed.&nbsp;
</p>
<h2><a name="realistic">The model must be realistic</a></h2>
<p>Most important of all, is the continuing requirement that in quantum chemical 
calculations each data set must 
represent a realistic system. In Molecular Mechanics, hydrogen atoms are often 
ignored or combined into the heavy atom that they are bonded to, to give the 
&quot;combined atom&quot; model.&nbsp; In quantum mechanical calculations, every hydrogen 
atom must be explicitly defined. </p>
<p>Some residues are usually described as being ionized, thus Arg is usually 
represented as [Arg]<sup>+</sup>, and Asp as [Asp]<sup>-</sup>.&nbsp; But if 
there is a large difference in numbers of anionic and cationic residues, the net 
charge on the system can be unrealistically large.&nbsp; Neutralizing individual 
residues requires making decisions that are hard to justify. To avoid having to 
make subjective decisions, a well-defined starting structure would be to use the 
completely neutral system.&nbsp; This is somewhat artificial in that there are 
almost certainly ions present in the system, but usually, during geometry 
optimization, protons will migrate from carboxylic acid groups to form 
carboxylate anions, and some Arg and Lys will become cations.</p>
<p>Systems involving most open-shell simple transition metal complexes, such as 
Cr(III) surrounded by six oxygen atoms, should not be run.&nbsp; If an attempt 
were made to run [Cr<sup>III</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> it 
would fail because the number of electrons (51) is odd.&nbsp; Changing the 
charge from +3 to +4 would likely change the character of the chromium too much 
for the results to be useful.</p>
<p>Another example of a faulty starting geometry would be DNA in which every 
phosphate group was singly ionized.&nbsp; If the geometry of such a system was 
calculated, the results would be nonsense - the very large net negative charge 
would cause the DNA to spontaneously untwist, ruining the structure.&nbsp; Only 
when the phosphate groups are neutralized, or counterions are present to 
neutralize charges, can the characteristic twist be 
reproduced.</p>
<h2><a name="Identifying_charged_sites">Identifying charged sites</a></h2>
<p>All ionized sites can be identified by keyword <TT><a href="charges.html">CHARGES</a></TT>.&nbsp; If this keyword 
is used, the charged sites and net charge will be printed, and the calculation 
stopped.&nbsp; This is a quick and reliable way of finding ionized sites.&nbsp; 
If an attempt is made to run a system with the wrong charge, either because a 
mistake was made in the structure, or because the assumed net charge was 
incorrect, the error will be detected and the job stopped.&nbsp; However, if 
keyword <TT><a href="charge.html">CHARGE</a></TT> is not present or
<a href="geo-ok.html"><TT>GEO-OK</TT></a> is present, the supplied charge will 
be replaced with the calculated charge, and the job will be run using the 
calculated charge.</p>
<h2><a name="Identifying_ionized_residues">Identifying ionized residues</a></h2>
<p>When any keyword that implies that the residue sequence should be used, e.g., 
<a href="pdbout.html"><TT>PDBOUT</TT></a> or<TT> <a href="residues.html">
RESIDUES</a></TT>, or if the residue 
sequence can be deduced from the data set, then the net charge on each residue 
is printed.&nbsp; If the charge on a residue is larger than 0.5, the residue 
will be labeled &quot;CATION&quot;, if it is less than -0.5, it will be labeled &quot;ANION&quot;.</p>
<h2><a name="Ramachandran_angles">Ramachandran angles</a></h2>
<p>When <a href="rama.html"><TT>RAMA</TT></a> is present, the three 
Ramachandran angles, &psi;, &phi;, 
and &alpha; are printed for each residue.</p>
