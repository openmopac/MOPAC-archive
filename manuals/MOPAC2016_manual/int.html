<TT>INT</TT>
</h1>
Regardless of what type of coordinates are used in the data set, <TT>INT</TT>
will force all the coordinates to be internal coordinates.  Atom 1 is,
by definition, always defined in Cartesian coordinates.
<P>Notes</P>
<ul>
  <li>If&nbsp; <TT>INT</TT> is used, the optimization flags are not changed.
  Therefore, before running a system with&nbsp;<TT>INT</TT> all the
  optimization flags should be set to &quot;1&quot;, except for atoms 1, 2, and 3.
  For atom 1, all optimization flags should be set to &quot;0&quot;, for atom 2, the
  second and third flags should be &quot;0&quot;, and for atom 3 the third flag should be
  &quot;0&quot;.</li>
  <li>Be very careful if some atoms have optimization flags set to &quot;0&quot;.&nbsp; If 
  the geometry supplied is in Cartesian coordinates, and an atom, say atom 10, 
  has all three optimization flags set to &quot;0&quot;, then that means &quot;Do not change 
  the Cartesian coordinates of atom 10.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; If that atom is converted 
  to internal coordinates, the optimization flags will still be zero, but now 
  the definition changes to &quot;Do not change the bond length, angle, and dihedral 
  of atom 10, with reference to the atoms used for the connectivity.&quot;&nbsp; Now 
  atom 10 will move if the atom it is attached to moves. This is fundamentally 
  different from the Cartesian coordinate definition.</li>
  <li>Any dummy atoms are automatically deleted if <TT>INT</TT> is
  present.&nbsp; This is because the first step in running <TT>INT</TT> is to
  convert the system to Cartesian coordinates.&nbsp; This involved deleting any
  dummy atoms.&nbsp; The next step involves conversion from Cartesian to
  internal coordinates.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;<TT>INT</TT> is a rapid and efficient way of deleting atoms from a
  molecule that is defined using internal coordinates.&nbsp; Re-label the atoms
  to be deleted as dummy atoms, and run <TT>INT</TT> with <TT>
  <a href="zero_scf.html">0SCF</a>.</TT> </li>
