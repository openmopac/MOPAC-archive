<TT>AUTOSYM</TT>
</h1>
<TT>AUTOSYM</TT> is an alternative way of specifying symmetry.  When
<TT>AUTOSYM</TT> is present, symmetry data is generated.  This data is similar to
that supplied by the user when <TT><a href="symmetry.html">SYMMETRY</a></TT> is used.  The 'rules'
<TT>AUTOSYM</TT> uses are these:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>All bond-lengths which are within 0.0001&Aring; are set equal.
<LI>All bond-angles which are within 0.0057<IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$^{\circ}$">
are set equal.
<LI>All dihedral angles which are within 0.0057<IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$^{\circ}$">
are set equal.
<LI>All dihedral angles which are within 0.0057<IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img98.gif"
 ALT="$^{\circ}$">
of the negative
of an existing dihedral are set equal to the negative of the existing
dihedral.
</UL>
<P>
These 'rules' are a re-wording of internal <TT>SYMMETRY</TT> functions 1, 2, 3,
and 14.  The <TT>.arc</TT> file will include the symmetry data.  In order to
change the <TT>.arc</TT> file symmetry data into normal symmetry data, change
<TT>AUTOSYM</TT> in the <TT>.arc</TT> file to <TT>SYMMETRY</TT>.
<P>
AUTOSYM only adds symmetry to coordinates that can be optimized.&nbsp; If a 
coordinate has an optimization flag of &quot;0&quot;, it will not be looked at by AUTOSYM.<br>
<br>
Consider benzene:&nbsp; If someone built the Z-matrix in internal coordinates, they 
would likely mark the C-C and C-H distances as optimizable, and lock the angles 
and dihedrals.&nbsp; If they used AUTOSYM, then it would symmetry-relate all the C-C 
distances and all of the C-H distances, but leave the angles and dihedrals 
untouched.&nbsp;<br>
