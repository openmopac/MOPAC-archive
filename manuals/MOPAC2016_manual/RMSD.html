To calculate the RMS difference between two geometries, use the <tt>
<a href="geo_ref.html">GEO_REF</a> </tt> keyword 
and <tt><a href="zero_scf.html">0SCF</a></tt>.&nbsp; This 
calculation is very fast, it typically only takes a few seconds of CPU time. For this type of calculation, a 
convenient option is to also use <tt><a href="geo_dat.html">GEO_DAT</a></tt>, so the 
data-set could be as short as one line(although three lines would allow the job 
to have a title and comment).<p align="left">
Caveats:<p align="left">
Both systems must have the same number of atoms and the same empirical formula.<p align="left">
If PDB information is present, this will be used, in which case every atom must 
have a unique PDB label.&nbsp; Atom numbers in labels do <em>not</em> count in 
determining the PDB label.<p align="left">
If the RMS can be reduced by swapping pairs of atoms, this will be done.&nbsp; 
To prevent swapping, add <tt><a href="noswap.html">NOSWAP</a></tt>.
