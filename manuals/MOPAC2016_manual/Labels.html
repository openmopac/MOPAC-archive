<H2>Description of Atom Labels</H2>
<p>The most simple definition of an atom is to use either its chemical symbol or 
its atomic number, thus:</p>
<p>Mg 1.23 1 1.23 1 1.23 1&nbsp; or<br>
12&nbsp; 1.23 1 1.23 1 1.23 1</p>
<p>If <a href="Isotope_specification.html">isotopes</a> are used, then the 
atomic number option cannot be used.</p>
<p>In addition to the symbol or atomic number, a label can be added to an atom.&nbsp; 
The format of the label is: &quot;(<i>text</i>)&quot; (without the quotation marks), that 
is, &quot;open curved bracket, <i>text</i>, closed curved bracket&quot; The 
label should be immediately after the chemical symbol or after the isotopic 
mass, if present.</p>
<p><i>text</i> can be up to 38 characters long, but much shorter descriptions 
should normally be used, otherwise the layout of the output becomes very messy.&nbsp;
<i>text</i> can be any description that does not involve any of the symbols &quot;)&quot;, 
or &quot;+&quot;, or &quot;-&quot; if&nbsp; <a href="mozyme.html"><TT>MOZYME</TT></a> is used.</p>
<p>Examples of atom labels:</p>
<p>Mg(At center of porphyrin ring) 1.23 1 1.23 1 1.23 1 <br>
&nbsp;C( 17 PHE* 2) 1.19 1 4.59 1 -0.18 1<br>
&nbsp;C14.0( 17 PHE* 2) 1.19 1 4.59 1 -0.18 1</p>
<p>A special type of atom label is used in protein work.&nbsp; These labels are 
exactly 26 characters long, and correspond to the first 26 characters of a PDB 
file.&nbsp; Labels for atoms in proteins can be generated in two ways:<br>
(A) When a PDB file is read in, the resulting MOPAC data set has the atoms 
labeled automatically.&nbsp; See also <a href="atom_numbers.html">atom numbering</a>.&nbsp; <br>
(B) When a MOPAC data set is read in, and there is enough information in the 
atom labels to allow the PDB atom labels to be written.</p>
<p>If <a href="residues.html"><TT>RESIDUES</TT></a> is present, the resulting ARC file 
will include labels on each atom. If <TT>RESIDUES</TT> is used, all existing 
labels, including labels defining individual charges, will be replaced.</p>
<h3>Atom Charges</h3>
<p>Charges on individual atoms for use in MOZYME can be specified by the 
symbols &quot;+&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, and &quot;-&quot; in the atom labels. When the symbol &quot;+&quot; 
is present, the atom is given a unit positive charge, when &quot;0&quot; is present, the 
atom will be given a zero charge, and when &quot;-&quot; is present, the 
atom is given a unit negative charge.&nbsp; The zero charge option is useful 
when metal ions in enzymes are being modeled, thus the MoO<sub>2</sub> moiety 
should have Mo<sup>IV</sup>, but by default, Mo is Mo<sup>VI</sup>, i.e., [MoO<sub>2</sub> 
]<sup>2+</sup>. To specify that Mo<sup>IV</sup> should be used, after Mo add a 
&quot;0&quot; to give Mo0. Avoid using these keywords unless 
necessary.&nbsp; Thus if the ethyl group, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, is run 
with <a href="charge.html"><TT>CHARGE=1</TT></a>, then the CH<sub>2</sub> carbon will 
automatically be given a positive charge, if <TT>CHARGE=-1</TT> is present, the it will 
be given a negative charge.</p>


<p>See also <TT><a href="setpi.html">SETPI</a></TT> to explicitly assign &pi; bonds, also <a href="CVB.html"><TT>CVB</TT></a> to explicitly make or 
break bonds.</p>
