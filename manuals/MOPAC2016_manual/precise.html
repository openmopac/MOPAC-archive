<TT>PRECISE</TT> </h1>
<P>Non-LBFGS jobs:&nbsp; The criteria for terminating all optimizations, electronic and geometric, are to be increased by a factor, 
normally 100. This can be used where more precise results are wanted. If the results are going to be used in a <TT>
<a href="force.html">FORCE</a></TT> calculation, where the geometry needs to be known quite precisely, then <TT>PRECISE</TT> is recommended; for small systems the extra cost in CPU time is minimal. <TT>PRECISE</TT> is not recommended for experienced users; instead, <TT>
<a href="gnorm.html">GNORM=<I>n</I>.<I>nn</I></a></TT> and <TT>
<a href="scfcrt.html">SCFCRT=<I>n</I>.<I>nn</I></a></TT> or <TT>
<a href="relscf.html">RELSCF=<I>n</I>.<I>nn</I></a><I> </I></TT> are suggested. <TT>PRECISE</TT> should only rarely be necessary in a <TT>FORCE</TT> calculation: all it does is remove quartic contamination, which only affects the trivial modes significantly, and is very expensive in CPU time.&nbsp; </P>
<P>LBFGS jobs: In the <a href="lbfgs.html"><tt>LBFGS</TT></a> procedure, if&nbsp; <TT>PRECISE</TT> 
is present then the number of cycles used in identifying the lowest-energy 
system is increased from 30 to 60.&nbsp; </P>
