<TT>HTML </TT>&nbsp;<tt> HTML(NORES)</TT></h1>
<p>&nbsp;When <tt>HTML</tt> is present a simple web-page will be 
written.&nbsp; This web-page is intended for use with
the Graphical-User Interface <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsmol/", target="_parent">JSmol</a>, the successor to 
Jmol.&nbsp;&nbsp; To suppress printing of the residue sequence, use <tt>HTML(NORES).</tt>&nbsp; 
If charges are calculated, these will be put in columns 62-66 of the PDB file 
written by keyword <tt>HTML</tt>, and these will be available in the web-page.</p>
<p>Proteins are large, complicated organic compounds, and visualizing them is 
difficult.&nbsp; There are many good GUI's, one of which is 
JSmol; JSmol allows fine control over the display of features in a protein.&nbsp; 
The web-page written by MOPAC when <tt>HTML</tt> is present uses JSmol to 
display the protein.&nbsp; JSmol allows simple editing of structures.</p>
<h2>Animations</h2>
<p>Two different modes are provided for showing animations.</p>
<h3>Animations with one graph showing the molecule and next to it another graph 
showing the energy profile.</h3>
<p>Use keyword <tt>HTML</tt> plus keywords that produce a set of frames, e.g., <tt>
<a href="irc0.html">IRC</a></tt>, <tt><a href="drc0.html">DRC</a></tt>, 
<tt><a href="step.html">STEP</a></tt>, etc., but do NOT use keyword <tt>
<a href="pdbout.html">PRBOUT</a></tt>.</p>
<h3>Animations with a graph showing the system in PDB format with the option to 
show charges.</h3>
<p>Use keywords <tt>HTML </tt> and <tt>PRBOUT </tt> plus keywords that produce a 
set of frames, e.g., <tt>IRC</tt>, <tt>DRC</tt>, 
<tt>STEP</tt>, etc.</p>
<p>For several examples, see
<a href="Individual%20JSmol%20paths/Animations.html">Animations</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Requirements for displaying and editing a protein using JSmol</h2>
<p>The JSmol software must be present.&nbsp; The files and folders needed for 
using JSmol with MOPAC can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/latest/download?source=files", target="_parent">
latest Jmol distribution</a>. This involves downloading a 
file with a name like &quot;Jmol-14.0.13-binary.zip&quot; Open the ZIP file, and select jsmol.zip.&nbsp; Extract the folder in jsmol.zip. By default, JSmol will be put 
into a folder called &quot;jsmol&quot;.&nbsp; Then follow the instructions in
<a href="README_for_JSmol.html">
HTTP://OpenMOPAC.net/Manual/README_for_JSmol.html</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Prepare a MOPAC data set for the protein.&nbsp; The name of the data set will 
be used for both the HTML file and for the PDB file that MOPAC will make. For 
this description, let the name of the data set be &quot;test.mop&quot;&nbsp; Edit the data 
set to add keywords &quot;0SCF HTML&quot;&nbsp; The next line, a user-controlled 
text line, should have the title of the web-page, e.g. &quot;Chymotrypsin&quot;&nbsp; Run 
&quot;test.mop&quot; using MOPAC, this will create some files, including &quot;test.html&quot; and &quot;test.pdb&quot;&nbsp; 
At this point, have a quick look at these files using a text editor, they should 
look like a normal HTML and a normal PDB file.</p>
<p>Copy the files &quot;test.html&quot; and &quot;test.pdb&quot; into the folder 
&quot;jsmol&quot;, then open &quot;test.html&quot; 
using Firefox (other browsers - Internet Explorer and Chrome were tested - they 
didn't work!).&nbsp; Once everything works, 
use the instructions in
<a href="README_for_JSmol.html">
HTTP://OpenMOPAC.net/Manual/README_for_JSmol.html</a> to modify Firefox so you 
don't need to copy the HTML and PDB files into the jsmol folder - this will make 
running the HTML files much easier.</p>
<h3>Displaying parts of the protein</h3>
<p>The first JSmol picture is that of the entire protein.&nbsp; This is too 
complicated to be of any use, so click on &quot;Toggle display all&quot; - this will 
delete everything.&nbsp; Clicking &quot;Toggle display all&quot; again will put everything 
back.&nbsp; Start with everything deleted, i.e., an empty picture.&nbsp; Now 
look at the list of residues.&nbsp; Clicking on a residue will display it, 
clicking on it again will delete it.&nbsp; Build up the part of the protein you 
are interested in.</p>
<p>The other controls are easy to use. </p>
