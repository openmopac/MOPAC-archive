<h1 class="auto-style1">How to run Program BZ (<a href="Program_BZ.html">Back</a>)</h1>
<p class="auto-style2">Windows is the only operating system supported.</p>
<h2>Three options for running BZ</h2>
<p>All methods of running BZ are equivalent; the only difference is in the 
way that BZ is opened.&nbsp; Also, all methods require a file of the type &lt;file&gt;.brz.&nbsp; 
These files are generated by MOPAC automatically when keyword
<a href="mers.html"><tt>MERS</tt></a> is present.&nbsp; Use whichever method you prefer. 
Start by putting the program BZ.exe in a folder on your machine, in a location 
of your choice.&nbsp; A suitable location would be one where it is not likely to 
be accidentally deleted.</p>
<h3>Double-clicking</h3>
<p>This is probably the easiest method.&nbsp; To set this up, right-click on a .brz 
file, then chose &quot;Open&quot;. Select &quot;Select a program from a list of installed 
programs&quot; then click on &quot;OK&quot;.&nbsp; Browse to the BZ.exe folder and left-click 
on BZ.exe. Click on &quot;Open&quot;. That will take you back to the &quot;Open with&quot; window. 
Check &quot;Always use the selected program to open this type of file&quot; then click on 
&quot;OK&quot;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Once the default program is set up, double-clicking on a &lt;file&gt;.brz file will 
start BZ running.</p>
<h3>&quot;Drag and drop&quot;</h3>
<p>Copy the BZ.exe file and paste a shortcut onto the desktop so that it is an 
icon.&nbsp; Then select a .brz file and drag and drop it onto the icon.&nbsp; If 
a .dat file is to be used, select the .brz file and the .dat file and drag and 
drop them onto the BZ icon.</p>
<h3>At the command-prompt level</h3>
<p>This option is only useful when &quot;drag and drop&quot; cannot be used.</p>
<p>The command:</p>
<p>&quot;C:/&lt;folder that holds BZ.exe&gt;/BZ.exe&quot; &lt;file&gt;.brz [&lt;file.dat&gt;]</p>
<p>will run BZ with an optional &lt;file&gt;.dat.&nbsp; If used, the &lt;file&gt;.dat file 
should contain information on the path through <em>k</em>-space that is to be 
drawn.</p>
<h3>Rename the &lt;file&gt;.dat file</h3>
<p>All the data that are typed into the a BZ run are saved and written to a file 
&lt;file&gt;.dat.&nbsp; This file can then be used to re-generate the band structure 
or little groups for the system.&nbsp; At the start, when exploring the <em>k</em>-space 
of a solid, mistakes will be made.&nbsp; This is expected.&nbsp; Eventually a 
set of data will be typed into BZ that will produce a good graphic or output.&nbsp; 
At that point, rename the &lt;file&gt;.dat to give it a new name that indicates what 
it represents.&nbsp; For example, a surface that includes the <em>k</em>-space 
point &quot;L&quot; in the phonon spectrum of diamond, done using a file &quot;Diamond for 
Phonon with ops.brz&quot;, would be named &quot;Diamond for Phonon with ops.dat&quot;.&nbsp; 
Such a file should be re-named, e.g., &quot;Diamond for Phonon with ops surface L.dat&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Eventually a set of data-files will be made, with each data-file representing 
one detail of the band-structure in the Brillouin zone.</p>
