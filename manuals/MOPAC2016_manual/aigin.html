If the geometry (Z-matrix) is specified using the Gaussian
format&nbsp;[<a href="references.html#gaussian_92">14</a>],  then this  will normally be read in without
difficulty.  In the event that it is mistaken for a  normal  MOPAC-type
Z-matrix,  the  keyword  <TT>AIGIN</TT>  is provided. <TT>AIGIN</TT> will force the
data-set to be read in assuming Gaussian format.  This is necessary if more
than one system is  being  studied  in one run.
