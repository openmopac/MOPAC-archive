 Exercises involving eigenvectors</A>
</H2>
In the following exercises 'verify' means using a hand calculator. They are
intended to confirm understanding of the theory involved. Work though one or
more examples to confirm the validity of the statement that follows.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.  Verify that the eigenvectors are normalized.
<DT>2.  Verify that the eigenvectors are orthogonal to each other.
<DT>3.  Verify that the eigenvalues are correct.
<DT>4.  Verify that the eigenvectors diagonalize the Fock matrix.
<DT>5.  Verify that the diagonal sum rule is obeyed; i.e., that the sum of the
eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the diagonal matrix elements (the trace) of
the Fock matrix.
