In polymers and solids, a cutoff distance, in &Aring;ngstroms, is needed in order to ensure that
every atom has a correct electric environment.  If no cutoff is set, then
equivalent atoms would experience different electric fields.  The <TT>CUTOFP</TT>
distance is set, by default, to 30 &Aring;ngstroms.  In calculating the potential
due to distant atoms, atoms separated by more than <TT>CUTOFP</TT> are treated
as if they were at distance <TT>CUTOFP</TT>.
<p>
<a href="mozyme.html"><TT>MOZYME</TT></a> calculations run faster when smaller 
values of <TT>CUTOFP</TT> are used&nbsp; A suitable value for<i> n.nn</i> is 
somewhere between 10.0 and 15.0.&nbsp; This will give a 
large increase in speed. But first, run a test calculation to verify that the 
results don't change much.</p>
<p>
When <TT>CUTOFP</TT> is less than the default, the number of two-electron 
integrals is reduced.&nbsp; This can allow larger systems to be run.</p>
