By default, MOPAC uses the CODATA fundamental physical constants.
This means that the results of MOPAC 6 and earlier MOPAC calculations
cannot be duplicated.  When <TT>OLDFPC</TT> is specified, the
fundamental physical constants used in earlier MOPACs is used.  This allows
these earlier calculations to be duplicated using the current MOPAC.
<P>
Users are advised to not use <TT>OLDFPC</TT> except when comparison or continuity
with earlier MOPACs is necessary, as all future MOPACs will use the new
CODATA constants.
