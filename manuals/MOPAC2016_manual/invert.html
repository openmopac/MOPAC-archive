<TT>INVERT</TT> </h1>
<p>When
<TT>INVERT</TT> is present, all optimization flags are reversed.&nbsp; That is, 
if an optimization flag is &quot;1&quot;, it will be set to &quot;0&quot;, and if it is &quot;0&quot;, it will 
be set to &quot;1&quot;</p>
<p>
Refinement of a transition state for a large system runs faster when only the 
atoms near to the transition state are used in gradient minimization, and the 
rest are used in energy minimization. <TT>INVERT</TT> is 
useful for calculations of this type.&nbsp; The optimization flags for all atoms 
in the gradient minimization are set to &quot;1&quot;, the rest are set to &quot;0&quot;.&nbsp; In 
one calculation, a normal gradient minimization is run, in a second calculation 
a geometry optimization is run, with keyword
<TT>INVERT</TT> present.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
The two calculations can be combined into one job.&nbsp; For example, the first 
data set, for the gradient minimization, can be followed by a second data set 
consisting of keywords &quot;<a href="oldgeo.html"><TT>OLDGEO</TT></a>&quot; and &quot;<TT>INVERT</TT>&quot; plus any 
other keywords needed for the job.</p>
<p>
Alternatively, make two complete data sets, one for gradient minimization and 
one for energy minimization.&nbsp; Run these data sets on different computers.&nbsp; 
Then edit the resulting ARC files to make up a new data set.&nbsp; This saves 
time, because the jobs run twice as fast.</p>
