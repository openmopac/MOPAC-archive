Semiempirical methods could offer a feasible compromise between </font>
<font FACE="CMTI10" SIZE="4">ab initio </font>
<font FACE="NimbusSanL-Regu" SIZE="4">and empirical approaches for the 
calculation of large molecules with biological relevance. A key problem for 
attempts in this direction is the rather bad performance of current 
semiempirical methods for noncovalent interactions, especially hydrogen-bonding. 
Based on the recently introduced PM6-DH method, that includes empirical 
corrections for dispersion (D) and hydrogen-bond (H) interactions, we have 
developed an improved and transferable h-bonding correction for semiempirical 
quantum chemical methods. The performance of the improved correction is 
evaluated for PM6, AM1, OM3 and SCC-DFTB (enhanced by standard empirical 
dispersion corrections) with several test sets for non-covalent interactions and 
is shown to reach the quality of current DFT-D approaches for these types of 
problems.</p>
