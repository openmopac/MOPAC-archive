The spin matrix, defined as the difference  between  the  alpha  and beta
density  matrices,  is  to  be  printed.   If  the  system  has  a closed-shell
ground state, e.g.  methane run UHF, the spin matrix will be null.
<P>
If <TT>SPIN</TT> is not requested in a UHF calculation, then the diagonal  of the
spin matrix, that is the spin density on the atomic orbitals, will be printed.
