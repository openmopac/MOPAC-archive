<TT>BANANA</TT> 
</H2>
<p>In a <a href="localize.html"><tt>LOCALIZE</tt></a> calculation, localized 
M.O.'s (LMO's) in double and triple bonds are split into one LMO that is mainly sigma and one or two LMO's that are 
mainly pi.&nbsp; For example, a triple bond would consist of a sigma LMO and two 
pi LMO's.</p>
<p>When <tt>BANANA</TT> is present, a <tt>LOCAL</tt> 
calculation will be done, and these double and triple bond LMO's will be replaced with hybrid LMO's that have equal 
amounts of sigma character in each M.O.&nbsp; The resulting LMO's are commonly 
referred to as banana-bonds because of their shape, although they really look 
more like éclairs than bananas.&nbsp; Other LMO's that cannot 
be mixed without changing their localization properties, such as sigma LMO's in 
single bonds are not affected when <tt>BANANA</TT> is present.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>All three sets of M.O.'s, canonical, localized, and localized with  
<tt>BANANA</tt>, are equivalent, in that the sets are related to each other by unitary 
transforms. Use whichever set best first the current needs.</p>
