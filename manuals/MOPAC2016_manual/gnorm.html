<P>The geometry optimization termination criteria (see
<a href="Geometry_criteria.html">Criteria</a>) in both gradient minimization and energy minimization can be over-ridden by specifying a gradient norm requirement. For example, <TT>GNORM=20</TT> would allow the geometry optimization to exit as soon as the gradient norm dropped below 20.0 
kcal/mol/<font face="Times New Roman">&Aring;ngstrom</font>, the default being 1.0. </P>
<P>For proteins and solids, i.e., large systems, <TT>GNORM=10</TT> should be 
used.&nbsp; Lower values might work, but there is an increased risk of the heat 
of formation not decreasing, and all that happens is that CPU time is wasted.</P>
<P>For small system high-precision work, <TT>GNORM=0.0</TT> is recommended. Unless <TT>
<a href="let.html">LET</a></TT> is also used, the <TT>GNORM</TT> will be set to the larger of 0.01 and the specified <TT>GNORM</TT>. Results from <TT>GNORM=0.01</TT> are easily good enough for all high-precision work. </P>
<P>N.b.: Do not confuse <TT>GNORM</TT>, the keyword, with GNORM, the value of the scalar of the calculated gradient. 
The keyword <TT>GNORM</TT> defines the criterion for an optimized geometry,&nbsp; GNORM 
is the value calculated during a geometry optimization, and is printed in the 
output at the end of each cycle.&nbsp; When&nbsp; GNORM, drops below the level 
set by <TT>GNORM=n.nn</TT>, the geometry optimization will terminate.</P>
