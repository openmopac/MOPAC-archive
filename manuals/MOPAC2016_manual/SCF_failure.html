<H3>Causes of failure to achieve an SCF </H3>
<P>In a system where a biradical can form, such as ethane decomposing into two CH<SUB>3</SUB> units, the normal RHF procedure can fail to go self-consistent. If the system has marked biradicaloid character, then <A HREF="biradical.html">BIRADICAL</A> or <A HREF="uhf.html">UHF</A> and <A HREF="triplet.html">TRIPLET</A> can often prove successful. These options rely on the assumption that two unpaired electrons can represent the open shell part of the wave-function. </P>
