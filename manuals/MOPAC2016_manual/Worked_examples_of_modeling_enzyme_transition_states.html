<P>Some of the steps in modeling transition states for enzyme-catalyzed 
reactions are often difficult for users to run, but by looking at various worked 
examples of transition state location, refinement, characterization, etc., the 
general principles and ideas used in each step can be better understood.<P>All 
examples start from a PDB file, in most cases this would be downloaded from the 
Protein Data Bank and would be referred to by its accession code.&nbsp; Each example 
gives a description of the sequence of steps used in 
obtaining one or more transition states in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.<h3>
