When <TT>pKa</TT> is specified, the pKa of hydrogen atoms attached to oxygen atoms is 
calculated and printed.&nbsp; For a large set of <a href="../pKa_table.html">
compounds</a>, the average unsigned error is about 0.31 pKa units. </p>
<p align="left">
pKa is calculated using the O-H distance calculated using PM6, and a charge 
calculated using a method specifically designed to reproduce the charge for pKa.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">
Do not use COSMO in optimizing the geometry.&nbsp; Use PM6 only.&nbsp; When the 
pKa calculation is done on the optimized PM6 geometry, the COSMO technique is 
switched on temporarily in order to get a better charge on the hydrogen atom(s). 
Once the pKa calculation finishes, the COSMO is switchod off again.</p>
<p align="left">
Known problem: If an ionizable hydrogen is within hydrogen-bonding distance of 
an atom with a large negative charge, as in the ene-ol form of acetylacetone, 
then the predicted pKa will be much too negative.&nbsp; This is a consequence of 
the induced extra positive charge on that hydrogen.&nbsp; </p>
