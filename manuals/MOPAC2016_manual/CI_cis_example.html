This job illustrates how to calculate the energies of electronic states of 
formic acid resulting from one-electron excitation.<p align="left">
Data-set: <PRE><b> bonds
First, optimize the geometry of formic acid

Now calculate the excited states of formic acid</b></PRE>
There are two calculations in this data set.  In the first calculation, the 
geometry of formic acid is optimized.&nbsp; No keywords are needed for this 
operation, but because a blank line is not easy to see, the keyword
<a href="bonds.html"><tt>BONDS</TT></a> has been added. BONDS is not necessary, but is 
used here only to show where the keyword line is.<p>The second calculation is 
the Configuration Interaction (C.I.) calculation.&nbsp; This uses the optimized 
geometry of formic acid from the previous calculation (using
<a href="oldgeo.html"><tt>OLDGEO</TT></a>).&nbsp; Four C.I. keywords are used here:</p>
<p><a href="cis.html"><tt>CIS</TT></a>:&nbsp; Use only the ground state and those states 
that can be created by excitation of one electron.</p>
<p><a href="ci=n.html"><tt>C.I.=4</TT></a>: Use an active space of four molecular 
orbitals.&nbsp; Since this keyword is unqualified, these four M.O.s are the 
HOMO, HOMO-1, LUMO, and LUMO+1.&nbsp; That is, the two highest occupied and two 
lowest unoccupied M.O.s&nbsp; The C.I. thus involves four electrons.</p>
<p><a href="meci.html"><tt>MECI</TT></a>: Print out the microstates and the States.</p>
<p>Other keywords, such as <a href="singlet.html"><tt>SINGLET</TT></a> are unnecessary here, because no geometric operations are being done.</p>
<p>In the output, there are a total of nine states: one for the ground state and 
eight resulting from one-electron excitations.&nbsp; In most C.I. calculations, 
the ground state would be stabilized by C.I., but in this case Koopmans' theorem 
applies.&nbsp; This says that no state resulting from one-electron excitation 
from a ground state configuration will interact with the ground state.&nbsp; The 
ground state is included in the CIS calculation, to indicate its position in the 
energy spectrum.</p>
<p>The PMx-type methods in MOPAC are not accurate for predicting excitation energies, 
where possible use <a href="indo.html"><tt>INDO</TT></a> instead.&nbsp; INDO is 
similar to ZINDO.</p>
