<P>In a MOPAC calculation, the density matrix at the end of the calculation is to be output in a form suitable for input in another job. If an automatic dump due to the time being exceeded occurs during the current run, 
and <TT>DENOUT</TT> is present, then the density matrix will also be output. (see <TT>
<a href="restart.html">RESTART</a></TT>).&nbsp; The density matrix file is 
unformatted.&nbsp; To output the formatted file, use <TT>DENOUTF</TT>. </P>
<P>In both formatted and unformatted density files, the layout of the data is: 
Number of atomic orbitals, number of atoms, lower half triangle of density 
matrix elements.&nbsp; When the density file is used in a subsequent 
calculation, the number of atomic orbitals and number of atoms is compared with 
that expected.&nbsp; If they are different, an error message is printed, and the 
run is stopped.</P>
<P>In a MOZYME calculation, the LMOs at the end of the calculation are to be output in a form suitable for input in another job. If an automatic dump due to the time being exceeded occurs during the current run, 
and <TT>DENOUT</TT> is present, then the density matrix will also be output. (see <TT>RESTART</TT>).&nbsp; 
The formatted option, <TT>DENOUTF,</TT> is not available .</P>
