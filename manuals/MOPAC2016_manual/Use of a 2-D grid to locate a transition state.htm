<p>
&nbsp;The&nbsp; <a href="grid_calc.html">GRID</a>
calculation can be used.&nbsp; In this, two coordinates that are important in
the reaction are chosen, and the Potential Energy Surface for the optimized
geometry is generated for all reasonable values of these coordinates.&nbsp;
Visual inspection of the resulting map can usually provide a guide to the
transition state.&nbsp; Once the approximate transition state is determined, it
can be further refined using <TT>
