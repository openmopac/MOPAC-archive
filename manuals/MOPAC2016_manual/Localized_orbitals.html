<H2>Localized orbitals
</H2>
The molecular orbitals generated by diagonalization are normally delocalized
over the system.  By using a unitary transform of the occupied M.O.s, it is
possible to generate a set of molecular orbitals which are localized on from
one up to three centers.
<P>
These localized M.O.s are not eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian, nor are their
energies eigenvalues.  However, localized orbitals can be equated with the
single, double, triple, and delocalized <IMG
