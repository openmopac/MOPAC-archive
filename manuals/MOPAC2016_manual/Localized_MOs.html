 Localized M.O.s</A>
</H3>
In addition to being equivalent to the classical bonds, localized M.O.s are
useful in understanding chemical reactions, and other phenomena which take
place slowly relative to the speed of light: i.e., phenomena which take place
in 10<SUP>-12</SUP>s or slower.
<P>
Consider a S<SUB><I>N</I><SUP>2</SUP></SUB> reaction.  All the bonds forming and breaking can be seen
in the localized M.O.s.  Consider the reactive sites in a molecule (double bonds,
lone pairs, etc.).  These have exact equivalents in the localized M.O.s.  The
energies of localized M.O.s are indicative of the reactivity of the associated
electron pair.  Consider an excited, insulating polymer, such as excited
polyethylene.  The excited state is usually written with an asterisk (*), and
is generated simply by localizing the M.O.s of an excited polymer cluster.
