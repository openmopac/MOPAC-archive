<h1>Solvate or not solvate?</h1>
<p>By default, all systems are modeled in the gas phase.&nbsp; This means that 
any phenomenon that depends on solvent effects, such as the stabilization of 
ions on the surface of a protein, will not be modeled.&nbsp; When modeling 
proteins, use solvation (add keyword <a href="eps.html"><tt>EPS=78.4</tt></a>).&nbsp; It 
lowers the geometric error by about 15%.&nbsp; The jobs will take a longer time 
to run, but the model is more realistic, and it's normally worth the extra CPU 
time.</p>
<p>The exception is when the positions of the hydrogen atoms are being optimized 
and everything else is frozen.&nbsp; This operation does not involve the 
non-hydrogen atoms moving, so not using solvation will not affect the results 
significantly. Of course, in order to allow heats of formation to be compared, 
for example in testing for <a href="salt_bridges.html">salt bridges</a>, the set 
of keywords used should be the same, in particular if <tt>
EPS=78.4</tt> is used in&nbsp;one job it should be used in the other.</p>
