 Optimization of one unknown</A>
</H2>
If a system has exactly one coordinate to be optimized, then obviously one
line-search will optimize the geometry.  Because of this, the geometry
optimization is done a little differently.  Given the initial geometry, the
<span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f
</sub>&nbsp;is calculated, and the line-search started. Unlike the normal
line-search, however, the search is not stopped when the minimum is almost
reached, instead, the minimum is located with quite high precision.  After the
line-search is complete, the gradients are not <A NAME="BM17994">&#160;</A> calculated
(unless requested by <TT><a href="gradients.html">GRADIENTS</a></TT>). Instead, it is assumed that the
gradient is small, and the results are output.  This saves some time. However,
if <TT>GRADIENTS</TT> is <EM>not</EM> present, and the geometry is not at a
stationary point (because other coordinates are not optimized), then the
warning message that the geometry is not at a stationary point will not be
printed.
