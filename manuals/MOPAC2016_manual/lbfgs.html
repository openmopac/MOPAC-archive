</TT><P>Optimize the geometry using the L-BFGS function minimizer. This is 
based on the BFGS optimizer, but it does not store the inverse Hessian, instead 
it is calculated as needed. Because of this, the L-BFGS method uses very 
little storage, and is therefore suitable for optimizing very large systems. </P>

<P>The L-BFGS optimizer is the default if 100 or more variables are to be 
optimized.&nbsp; For such systems, L-BFGS is more efficient than Baker's 
Eigenfollowing, however there is no guarantee that the L-BFGS method will 
produce a minimum energy.&nbsp; In systems where two or more species are 
present, and only low-energy interactions bind the species together, the L-BFGS 
optimizer sometimes fails to produce a minimum energy system .&nbsp; 
If this happens, or if for any other reason the L-BFGS is not wanted, add keyword <a href="ef.html"><tt>EF</tt></a> or
<a href="bfgs.html"><tt>BFGS</tt></a>.&nbsp; Both these methods are more 
reliable for difficult systems.</P>

<h3>Note on use of L-BFGS with large systems, particularly proteins</h3>

<P>The L-BFGS optimization method does not explicitly minimize the heat of 
formation, see below, therefore it is possible for the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> to 
rise on going from one cycle to the next, particularly near the end of a 
geometry optimization run.&nbsp; As the objective of geometry optimization is 
finding the lowest-energy geometry, terminating an optimization with a structure 
that is not the lowest-energy calculated is not acceptable.&nbsp; This fault 
most often occurs in large system, especially in proteins, and to avoid it the 
optimization procedure has been modified as follows:</P>

<P>During a geometry optimization that uses the L-BFGS optimizer, the system 
with the lowest &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> is stored.&nbsp; At 
the beginning of a job, the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> 
is calculated and it, and the starting geometry, are stored.&nbsp; 
After each subsequent cycle, the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> is compared with the value 
in the store.&nbsp; 
If it is lower (more negative), then the values in the store are over-written 
with the current geometry and &Delta;H<sub>f</sub>, so that after every cycle the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub>  and geometry in the store 
are always the best values calculated.&nbsp; At the end of the run the working geometry will be replaced by whatever 
geometry was in storage if the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> of the working geometry is more positive than 
the value for the stored geometry.&nbsp; If that is done, then the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> of the 
lowest-energy geometry will be re-evaluated. The final output will then refer to 
this geometry.</P>
<P>This workaround is used for all jobs that use the L-BFGS optimizer that end 
normally, or if the job runs out of time, or the
<a href="shut.html">SHUT</a> command is issued.&nbsp; 
Warning: If a large job is restarted using <tt><a href="restart.html">RESTART</a></tt> and <a href="one_scf.html"><tt>1SCF</tt></a> is specified, then the workaround will not 
be used.&nbsp; For large jobs, if a <tt>1SCF </tt> is wanted and there is a 
risk of the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> in the &lt;file&gt;.RES file not being the lowest 
calculated, then use the final geometry from the output file from the previous run.&nbsp; </P>

<P >The defaults number of cycles for deciding if the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> is at 
a minimum is 30.&nbsp; This will be reset to 60 if keyword
<a href="precise.html"><tt>PRECISE</tt></a> is used, or to another value if <tt><a href="let.html">LET(nnn</a>)</tt>is used. 
This option is useful when there is a risk of the optimization stopping too far 
from the minimum.</P>

<P >For most jobs the final geometry will be the best, and this workaround  would not be used, but if the lowest-energy geometry is not the last 
geometry calculated by L-BFGS, then the message: &quot;<b>CURRENT BEST VALUE OF HEAT OF 
FORMATION</b>&quot; will be printed.</P>

<h3>Notes on the L-BFGS optimization method</h3>
<P>The L-BFGS optimization procedure is a limited memory variation of the 
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton algorithm.&nbsp; Rather 
than storing the Hessian, the L-BFGS method stores only the gradient vectors for 
the the last few geometries calculated.&nbsp; In MOPAC, a maximum of 12 gradient 
vectors are stored.&nbsp; It then uses this set of vectors to approximate 
individual elements of the Hessian as they are needed.&nbsp; It is good 
for large systems, such as proteins and other macromolecules and solids.&nbsp; 
In practice, it also seems to be the best geometry optimizer for systems of 
thirty or more atoms.&nbsp; Go on-line for more detail on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited-memory_BFGS">L-BFGS method</a></P>
<P>It uses the gradient only, by moving the atoms in the system in the downhill 
direction. Although the L-BFGS method does not use the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub>, for 
most systems it does minimize the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> as a side effect of 
minimizing the gradient.&nbsp; Although it is not explicit in the algorithm, the 
L-BFGS method, like the other geometry optimizers in MOPAC, does optimize the 
geometry to a ground state.&nbsp; There has not yet been a worked example of it 
optimizing an unconstrained geometry to a transition state.</P>
<P>Using only the gradient and not the &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> has advantages, in that when the 
L-BFGS method makes a bad step, it uses the results of that step to work out a 
better step.&nbsp; This leads to a more rapid descent to a stationary point on 
the Potential Energy Surface.</P>
