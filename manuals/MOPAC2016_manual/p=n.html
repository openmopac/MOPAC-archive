<TT>P=n.nn</TT>&nbsp; </H2>
<P>The effect of an applied pressure on a solid can be simulated by <TT>P=n.nn</TT>, 
where <TT>n.nn</TT> is the pressure in Newtons per square meter, or <TT>P=n.nnGpa</TT>, 
where <TT>n.nn</TT> is the pressure in Gigapascals.</P>
<P>Typical bulk moduli are in the order of 10 - 700 GPa (gigapascals), and typical pressures 
should be <TT>n.nn</TT> = 1.D<SUP>9</SUP> to <TT>n.nn</TT> =1.D<SUP>10</SUP> NM<SUP>-2</SUP>. 
In general, solids are subjected to compression only, not tension, therefore the sign of <TT>n.nn</TT> should normally be positive, e.g. <TT>P=2.D9</TT> 
or <TT>P=2.0GPa,</TT> however, for mechanically strong solids, negative pressures, even quite large pressures, can be used.</P>
<P>As the pressure rises, the calculated heat of formation will become more 
positive because energy must be used in generating the volume of the solid under 
pressure. Geometry optimization minimizes the total heat of formation =&Delta;H<sub>f</sub> of the solid + energy due to volume. The final geometry is 
then the optimized geometry at equilibrium with that pressure.</P>
<P>Bulk moduli, B, in Pascals, can be calculated from the change in unit cell volume at zero pressure (Vol(0)) 
to the unit cell volume under a pressure of <TT>P=n.nn</TT> (Vol(<TT>n.nn</TT> ) from:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">B=n.nn*Vol(0)/(Vol(0)-Vol(n.nn))</P>
<P ALIGN="left">For polymers, the applied strain is in units of Newtons per mole. That is, for one mole 
of polymer chains, stacked side by side, the applied force is <TT>n.nn</TT> Newtons. Suitable values 
for <TT>P=n.nn</TT> are in the order of 10<SUP>13</SUP> Newtons. In general, polymers are subjected to 
tension only, not compression, therefore the sign of <TT>n.nn</TT> should normally be negative, e.g. <TT>P=-2.D13</TT> .</P>
<P>Useful conversion factors are:</P>
<P>1 GPa = 10<SUP>9</SUP>N.M<SUP>-2</SUP> = 10<SUP>10</SUP>dynes.cm<SUP>-2</SUP> = 10<SUP>16</SUP>erg.m<SUP>-3</SUP> </P>
<P>1 GPa = 6.0221367/(4.184*10)kcal.mol<SUP>-1</SUP>.Angstrom<SUP>-3</SUP> = 0.14393kcal.mol<SUP>-1</SUP>.Angstrom<SUP>-3</SUP>.</P>
<P>so a unit cell of&nbsp; 100A<sup>3</sup> under 1 GPa would have an energy 
equivalent of 14.39 kcal.mol<SUP>-1</SUP>.</P>
