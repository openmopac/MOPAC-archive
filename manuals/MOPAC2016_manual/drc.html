In a DRC calculation, the 'half-life' for loss of kinetic energy  is
defined as <I>n</I>.<I>nnn</I> femtoseconds.  This is equivalent to the system cooling down.
If the 'half-life' is negative, energy will be added to the system.  This is
equivalent to heating it up.  If <I>n</I>.<I>nnn</I> is set to zero, infinite damping
simulating a very condensed phase is obtained.

<p>Here is an example of simulated annealing:</p>
<pre> DRC=50 bigcycles=1000 T-priority
Formaldehyde, starting with the C=O bond stretched by ~0.2 Angstroms
 
  O     0.0 +0    0.0 +0    0.0 +0                      
  C     1.4 +1    0.0 +0    0.0 +0     1     0     0      
  H     1.1 +1  121.0 +1    0.0 +0     2     1     0      
  H     1.1 +0  121.0 +0  180.0 +0     2     1     3        
</pre> As usual, 
the plus &quot;+&quot; signs are optional, the optimization flags will be ignored, and the 
coordinates will be converted to Cartesian at run-time.<p>DRC=50 - The half-life 
for cooling is 50 fs.</p>
<p><a href="bigcycles.html">bigcycles</a>=1000 - Restrict the run. If this 
keyword is not present, the job will produce a very large output.</p>
<p><a href="t-priority.html">T-priority</a> - There are two common styles for 
monitoring a DRC, time and motion.&nbsp; In this case time is used.</p>
