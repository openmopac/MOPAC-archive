<UL>
<LI>Group D<SUB>8<I>d</I></SUB> is missing. This group is characterized by the presence of a 16-fold S<I><SUB>n</I></SUB> axis. Only S<I><SUB>n</I></SUB> operations up to S<SUB>12</SUB> are checked for. As a result, D<SUB>8<I>d</I></SUB> would not be recognized. However, this is a rare point-group, and its loss should not be important. </LI>
<LI>Some systems which are insufficiently near to a given point group will be assigned to the nearest sub-group. For example, if
<a href="ref_data/sf6.mop">SF<SUB>6</SUB></a> is distorted so that two opposite F atoms are at a different distance to the other four, the system might be classified as O<I><SUB>h</I></SUB> or D<SUB>4<I>h</I></SUB>, depending on the degree of distortion. This shows up mainly in methyl groups, e.g.
<a href="ref_data/neoc5.mop">neopentane</a>, in which optimization normally stops before the angles of the hydrogens are fully optimized. </LI></UL>
