<p>When <a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF</tt></a> is used, the reference 
geometry is rotated and translated to give the maximum overlap with the data-set 
geometry.&nbsp; In some systems, a further increase in overlap can be obtained 
by swapping pairs of atoms in the reference data-set.&nbsp; An example would be 
to swap around two hydrogen atoms attached to the same atom, e.g., in a 
methylene or amine group.&nbsp; This operation is done automatically.&nbsp; To 
prevent automatic swapping, add <tt>NOSWAP</tt>.</p>
