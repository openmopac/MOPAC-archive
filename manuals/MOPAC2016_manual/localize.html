The occupied eigenvectors are transformed into a  localized&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="references.html#local">38</A>]  set  of
M.O.s by a series of 2 by 2 rotations which maximize
&lt;<i>&psi;</i><sup>4</sup>&gt;.
The
value of
1/&lt;<i>&psi;</i><sup>4</sup>&gt;&nbsp;
is a direct measure of the number of centers involved
in  the MO: thus, the value of
1/&lt;<i>&psi;</i><sup>4</sup>&gt;&nbsp;
is 2.0 for H<SUB>2</SUB>, 3.0 for a
three-center bond and 1.0 for a  lone  pair.   Higher  degeneracies  than
allowed by point group theory are readily obtained.  For example, benzene
would give rise to a 6-fold degenerate C-H bond, a 6-fold degenerate  C-C
sigma  bond and a three-fold degenerate C-C pi bond.  In principle, there
is no single step method to unambiguously obtain the most  localized  set
of  M.O.s  in  systems  where several canonical structures are possible,
just as no simple method exists for finding the most stable conformer  of
some  large  compound.   However,  the  localized  bonds  generated  will
   normally be quite acceptable  for  routine  applications.
<p>Localized orbitals are also known as Natural Bond Orbitals or NBO.</p>
