Although MOZYME will normally recognize all the elements in a PDB file, the
possibility exists that an element or entity will be defined in a PDB file
in an unusual way, and as a result it will not be recognized.  To allow for this,
the keyword <TT>PDB(<I>text</I>)</TT> is provided.  The <I>text</I> is composed of a series
of entries of form 'Chemical-symbol:Atomic number', separated by commas.
Thus if a PDB had some hydrogen atoms represented by the symbol <I>J</I>, and
a bromine atom represented by <I>QW</I>, then these symbols would be correctly
recognized by MOZYME if <TT>PDB(J:1,QW:35)</TT> were specified on the keyword line.
 
Entities which do not correspond to elements can be excluded by assigning them
the atomic number zero, e.g. <TT>PDB(LP:0)</TT> would exclude any explicitly
defined lone-pairs.
