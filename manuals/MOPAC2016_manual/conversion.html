<P>MOPAC can accept any of the following formats: Cartesian, MOPAC internal coordinates, a mixture of Cartesian and MOPAC internal coordinates,&nbsp; and Gaussian internal coordinates. Both MOPAC and Gaussian Z-matrices can also contain dummy atoms. If the <TT>0SCF</TT> option is requested, the geometry defined on input will be printed in MOPAC Z-matrix format, along with other optional formats. </P>
<P>The type(s) of geometry printed at the end of a <A HREF="zero_scf.html">0SCF</A> calculation depend only on the keywords <A HREF="xyz.html">XYZ</A>, <A HREF="int.html">INT</A>, <A HREF="aigout.html">AIGOUT</A>,&nbsp; and <A HREF="noxyz.html">NOXYZ</A>. The geometry printed is independent of the type of input geometry, and therefore makes a convenient conversion mechanism. </P>
<P>If <TT>XYZ</TT> is present, all dummy atoms are removed and the internal coordinate definition remade. All symmetry relations are lost if <TT>XYZ</TT> is used. </P>
<P>If <TT>NOXYZ</TT> is present, Cartesian coordinates will not be printed. If <TT>AIGOUT</TT> is present, a data set using Gaussian Z-matrix format is printed. </P>
<P>Note: Only if the keyword <A HREF="symmetry.html">SYMMETRY</A> is present in a MOPAC internal coordinate geometry, or two or more internal coordinates in a Gaussian Z-matrix have the same symbolic will symmetry be present in the MOPAC or Gaussian geometries output. </P>
