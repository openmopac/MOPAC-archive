<p>By default, proteins are re-sequenced into the standard PDB file sequence, 
i.e., all atoms in a residue are contiguous, when keywords <tt>
<a href="ADD-H.html">ADD-H</a></tt> or <tt><a href="site.html">SITE</a> </tt> are 
used, or if the input data set is a pure PDB file.&nbsp; To prevent <tt>ADD-H</tt> or <tt>SITE</tt> 
from re-sequencing the data, add <tt>NORESEQ</tt>.&nbsp; To stop a pure PDB file 
from being resequenced, convert it to a MOPAC data set by adding the standard 
three lines to the start, and use keywords <tt>ADD-H</tt> and <tt>NORESEQ.</tt></p>
<p>Some PDB files contain severe topologic errors that confuse the residue 
recognition routine, a pre-requisite step for resequencing. Such errors result in a 
warning message being printed, and the run stopped.&nbsp; This type of problem 
occurs most often when adding hydrogen atoms using <tt>ADD-H.</tt>&nbsp; 
By default <tt>ADD-H</tt> uses the residue recognition routine, and a topologic 
problem could prevent <tt>ADD-H</tt> from working correctly.&nbsp; To avoid this problem, run <tt>ADD-H</tt> 
with <tt>NORESEQ;</tt> this avoids using the residue recognition routine.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Of course, the topologic problem is still present, even after hydrogen atoms are 
added.&nbsp; To correct the underlying problem, first optimize the positions of 
the hydrogen atoms, then optimize the positions of the atoms responsible for the 
topologic error.</p>
<p>Unless corrective action is taken, some topologic errors can result in an incorrect assignment of 
hydrogen atoms when using <tt>ADD-H</tt>.&nbsp; To correct this fault, use <a href="CVB.html"><tt>CVB</tt></a> 
with <tt>ADD-H</tt> 
and <tt>NORESEQ</tt>. This is an unusual use of <tt>CVB</tt> in that it normally 
cannot be used with <tt>ADD-H</tt>, but it is justified in this specific case.</p>
