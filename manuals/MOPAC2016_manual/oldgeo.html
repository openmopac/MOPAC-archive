        If multiple geometries are to be run, and the  final  geometry  from
   one  calculation  is  to  be  used  to start the next calculation, <TT>OLDGEO</TT>
   should be specified.  Example:  If MNDO, AM1, and PM3 calculation,  were
   to  be done on one system, for which only a rough geometry was available,
   then after the MNDO calculation, the AM1 calculation could be done  using
   the  optimized  MNDO  geometry  as  the  starting geometry, by specifying
   <TT>OLDGEO</TT>.  After the AM1 calculation was done, then a PM3 calculation
could also be done, starting with the old AM1 geometry, by again specifying
<TT>OLDGEO</TT>.
<p>When an <TT>OLDGEO</TT> calculation is started, none of the keywords from the 
previous calculation are assumed to be present.&nbsp; Thus, if the first 
calculation had keywords <TT><a href="pm3.html">PM3</a> <a href="root.html">ROOT=4</a>
<a href="cis.html">CIS</a> <a href="ci=n.html">C.I.=4</a></TT>, none of these 
keywords would be used by the <TT>OLDGEO</TT> calculation, unless they were 
explicitly present in the <TT>OLDGEO</TT> keyword line.</p>
