<TT>DISEX=<I>n</I>.<I>nn</I></TT>
</h1>
Used for the COSMO method (see <TT><a href="eps.html">EPS</a></TT>).  In units of mean segment diameter,
<I>n</I>.<I>nn</I> is the distance up to which the interactions of two segments is
calculated as the sum of fine grid interactions. The default value is 2.0.
<P>
<TT>DISEX</TT> should not be altered unless there are problems with  precision
(note: precision applies to the mathematics, and not to the   accuracy.)  To
increase the precision given by <TT>DISEX</TT>, set <TT>DISEX</TT>  to a smaller
number.   If, after running a job with <TT>DISEX</TT> set smaller,  e.g.
<TT>DISEX=1.8</TT>, the results have changed significantly, then reduce
<TT>DISEX</TT> again, and re-run the job.
