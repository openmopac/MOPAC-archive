<H2>Koopmans' Theorem.
</H2>
Koopmans' theorem&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="references.html#koopmans">59</A>] can be understood as follows:  for
closed-shell systems, the negative of the HOMO energy is the ionization
potential. That is, the energy required to form the cation <EM>provided that
the ionization process is adequately represented by the removal of an electron
from an orbital without change in the wave-functions of the other electrons.</EM>
<P>
The only alternative way to calculate the I.P. is to calculate the

 <span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub></A><sub> </sub>&nbsp;of the parent species, then, without allowing the geometry to relax,
calculate the
<A NAME="SECTION001223000000000000000">
 <span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub></A><sub> </sub>&nbsp;of the ionized system.  The difference in
<A NAME="SECTION001223000000000000000">
 <span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub></A><sub> </sub>,
in kcal.mol<SUP>-1</SUP>, divided by 23.06, is the predicted I.P., in eV.
