<p>If a job runs to completion, but the calculated Heat of Formation, &Delta;H<sub>f,</sub> is very 
large (over 10,000 kcal/mol) is likely that there is a fault in the 
geometry.&nbsp; If the job is re-run using keyword CHECK, the interatomic 
distances will be checked for atom distances of less than 0.9 &Aring;.&nbsp; If 
there are any such short distances, they will be reported and the job stopped.&nbsp; 
If none are found, the run will continue.</p>
