The keyword <TT>MOPAC</TT> is provided in order to allow compatibility with
earlier versions of MOPAC which did not require the connectivity of the second or third atoms to be explicitly
defined.  In general, <TT>MOPAC</TT> should be used for data sets constructed using
an editor; data sets generated by GUIs normally give the connectivities of
atoms 2 and 3.
