</h1>
At the end of a MOPAC job, when results are being printed, the density matrix
is  also  printed.  For RHF the normal density matrix is printed. For UHF the
sum of the alpha and beta density matrices is printed.
<P>
If density is not  requested,  then  the  diagonal  of  the  density matrix,
i.e.,  the  electron  density  on  the  atomic orbitals, will be printed.
<h3>
Excited state density matrices</h3>
<P>
When an excited state is calculated using the MECI method (see Multi-Electron 
Configuration Interaction method in <a href="theory.html">Theory</a>) the corresponding density matrix 
is constructed.&nbsp; Keywords that cause MECI to be used are
<a href="ci=nm.html"><TT>C.I.=<i>text</i></TT></a>, <a href="open.html"><TT>OPEN</TT></a>,
<a href="excited.html"><TT>EXCITED</TT></a>,&nbsp; and <a href="micros.html"><TT>MICROS</TT></a>. 
When <TT>DENSITY</TT> is present, the excited state density matrix is printed.&nbsp; The 
excited state used in constructing the density matrix is indicated in the MECI 
output by a &quot;+&quot; sign next to the state number in the list of state energies 
(state energies are printed when keyword <a href="meci.html"><TT>MECI</TT></a> is 
present)&nbsp; For transition dipoles or <a href="oscillator_strength.html">
oscillator strength</a>, also see the polarization values in the 
<TT>MECI</TT> output.</BODY></HTML>
