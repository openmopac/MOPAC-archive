<h1>Running a simple MOPAC job</h1>
<p>In protein work, all the systems you will be working with are very large, 
typically several thousand atoms.&nbsp; It's easy to get lost in such large 
systems, and if you don't know, or are not comfortable with, how MOPAC works, it 
would be doubly difficult.&nbsp; So before starting any work, run several small 
(four to ten atom) systems, to get a feel for what is involved. </p>
<p>But before doing anything, a few definitions are needed.&nbsp; In the 
instructions, some terms, such as &quot;data set&quot;, &quot;job&quot;, &quot;calculation&quot;, and &quot;step&quot; 
are often used.&nbsp; In MOPAC work, these terms have the following meaning:</p>
<h3>Data set</h3>
<p>A data set is a simple text file that contains information on what the system 
is, and what should be done.&nbsp; Data sets have names such as &quot;test.mop,&quot; 
&quot;1WDA.mop,&quot; &quot;Formaldehyde.mop,&quot; &quot;water.dat,&quot; &quot;H2O.inp.&quot; etc., although for most 
work the name should be descriptive of what is being done, e.g., &quot;1WDA adding 
hydrogen atoms.mop&quot; and the suffix should be &quot;.mop&quot;&nbsp; For more information 
see <a href="index_examples.html">Examples of Data-Sets</a>.</p>
<h3>Job</h3>
<p>A job is a single data-set that is run using MOPAC.&nbsp; A job can be 
simple, e.g., it might optimize the geometry of a molecule, or it might involve 
two or three calculations, e.g., optimize the geometry of a molecule, 
then, without stopping, calculate the vibrational frequencies of that molecule.&nbsp; 
When a geometry calculated in one step is to be used in a subsequent step,
<a href="oldgeo.html"><TT>OLDGEO</TT></a> is normally used. Only the first 
calculation requires a geometry to be supplied, all other calculations can 
either use their own geometry or use that of a previous step.</p>
<h3>Calculation</h3>
<p>In MOPAC work, a &quot;calculation&quot; is a simple job, either a stand-alone job, or 
a single step in a multi-step job.&nbsp; For example, suppose that the first 
step in a multi-step job is to optimize the geometry of a molecule, and the next 
step in that job would be to calculate the vibrational frequencies, then the 
data for the second step would consist of the lines:</p>
<p>...<br>
OLDGEO FORCE&nbsp; </p>
<p>appended to the end of the first calculation data set.</p>
<h3>Step</h3>
<p>A step and a calculation are the same.</p>
<h2>Running a simple MOPAC job</h2>
<p>Make up a simple data set for <a href="example_of_data.html">ethylene</a> 
and run it.&nbsp; Name the data set &quot;ethylene.mop&quot; and run it at the command 
prompt using the command: &quot;C:/program files/MOPAC2016.exe&quot; ethylene.mop&nbsp; 
(The quotation marks are needed for this command to work.)</p>
<p>In this example, <a href="int_coord_def.html">internal coordinates</a> are 
used, but in protein chemistry <a href="cart_coord.html">Cartesian coordinates</a> 
are used in almost all jobs.&nbsp; </p>
