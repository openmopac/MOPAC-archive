<h1>Installing MOPAC2016 instructions
</h1>
 <p>To install the MOPAC2016 executable, please read and follow the instructions in the file 
 &quot;Installation instructions.txt&quot; in the ZIP file you downloaded from 
 OpenMOPAC.txt.</p>
<p>The instructions for installing MOPAC2016 depend on the platform MOPAC2016 is 
to be run on, and may change from time to time. So instead of giving 
instructions here in the manual, it is safer to put the instructions with the 
executable.</p>
