The data can be read in and then printed, but  no  actual  calculation  is
performed  when  this  keyword is used.  This is useful as a check on the input
data.   All  obvious  errors  are  trapped,  and  warning  messages
printed.
A second use is to convert from one format to  another.   The  input
geometry  is printed in various formats in a <TT>0SCF</TT> calculation.
Normally, only the  Cartesian coordinate and MOPAC Z-matrix geometries are
printed, however other geometries can also be printed if other keywords are
used, e.g.  <TT><a href="aigout.html">AIGOUT</a></TT>.
