<TT>RABBIT and BANANA</TT> 
</H2>
<p>In a <a href="localize.html"><tt>LOCALIZE</tt></a> calculation, localized 
M.O.'s (LMO's) in double and triple bonds and on atoms with two or three lone 
pairs are split into one LMO that is mainly sigma and one or two LMO's that are 
mainly pi.&nbsp; For example, a triple bond would consist of a sigma LMO and two 
pi LMO's.</p>
<p>When either
<TT>RABBIT</TT> or <tt>BANANA</TT> is present in a <tt>LOCALIZE</tt> 
calculation, these LMO's would be replaced with hybrid LMO's that have equal 
amounts of sigma character in each M.O.&nbsp; In the case of double and triple 
bonds, the resulting LMO's are commonly referred to as banana-bonds because of 
their shape, although they look more like éclairs than bananas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In the case of two lone pairs on an atom, e.g., oxygen in a water molecule, the 
resulting LMO's are commonly referred to as rabbit-ears because of their shape, 
although they look make like ear-muffs than rabbit-ears. Other LMO's that cannot 
be mixed without changing their localization properties, such as sigma LMO's in 
single bonds and LMO's that represent a lone pair on an atom that has only one 
lone pair, are not affected when
<TT>RABBIT</TT> or <tt>BANANA</TT> is present.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>All three sets of M.O.'s, canonical, localized, and localized with RABBIT or 
BANANA, are equivalent, in that the sets are related to each other by unitary 
transforms. Use whichever set best first the current needs.</p>
