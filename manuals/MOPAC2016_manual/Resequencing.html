Resequencing</h1>
<p align="left">
To resequence the atoms in a data set, to put them into the standard PDB order, 
use <a href="reseq.html"><tt>RESEQ</tt></a>.</p>
<p align="left">
By default, when hydrogen atoms are added or removed, when keywords <tt>
<a href="ADD-H.html">ADD-H</a></tt> or <tt><a href="site.html">SITE</a> </tt> 
are used, or if the input data set is a pure PDB file, the atom sequence will be 
changed to that of the standard PDB format, i.e., all atoms in a given residue 
will be together in the new data-set.&nbsp; If this is not wanted, use <tt>
<a href="noreseq.html">NORESEQ</a>.</tt></p>

<p align="left">
Be aware that the PDB convention cannot, and does not, uniquely define the order 
of atoms in a residue.&nbsp; This is because there are sometimes two exactly 
equivalent ways of labeling an atom.&nbsp; This situation occurs in valine, 
leucine, arginine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine, and when two or more hydrogen 
atoms are attached to the same atom.&nbsp; This is not very important 
however, because operations in MOPAC that depend on atom sequences can correct 
most simple errors of this type, unless <a href="noswap.html"><tt>NOSWAP</tt></a> is present, and if the second sequence is different to the 
first sequence then the second sequence will be changed during the run to conform 
with the first sequence.</p>
