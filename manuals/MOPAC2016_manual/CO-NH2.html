<TITLE>Fault in PM6 in Prediction of Oxalic Acid geometry</TITLE>

<h1>Fault in PM6 in Prediction that R-COO-R + R-NH2 forms a stable system</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PM6 predicts that an organic acid and an amine should react to form a stable 
C-N bond.&nbsp; The fault does not appear with simple compounds, but can be 
shown in a <a href="CO-NH2_example.html">more 
complicated system</a>.</p>

<p>In this fault, R-NH2 reacts with R-COO-R to give R-NH2-C(R)OOR.&nbsp; The NH2 
is formally positive, and the C=O becomes C-O(-).</p>
