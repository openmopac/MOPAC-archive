Used by the&nbsp;
<a href="cosmo.html">COSMO</a>&nbsp; method to set the
effective radius of the solvent molecule to <I>n</I>.<I>nn</I>.  The default value
(1.3) is appropriate for water.
<P>
This quantity should be altered for each solvent.
One way to get <TT>RSOLV</TT> is to try several values for <TT>RSOLV</TT>, and see
which one gives the best solvation energies when compared with
experimental results.
<P>
Dr Klamt suggests: For COSMO-RS, use a solvent radius which is independent of
the solvent, e.g. R_solv = R_hydrogen = 1.3 Angstrom.&nbsp; Do not use a large
solvent radius for large solvents, because the solvent is not probing the solute
globally but locally. It is the local curvature which is relevant here, and a
general value of 1.3 Angstrom is normally reasonable.</BODY></HTML>
