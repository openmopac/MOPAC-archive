<TT><P>BCC</TT> is not used by MOPAC at all, but instead is used to inform programs
<a href="makpol.html">MAKPOL</a> and
<a href="Program_BZ.html">BZ</a> about the nature of the solid being studied. </P>
<TT><P>BCC</TT> should be specified if all odd unit cells are omitted, e.g. unit 
cells (0,0,1), (1,2,4), and (3,2,2) are excluded, but (0,0,0), (1,3,2), and 
(2,2,2) are included. An 
example is provided by diamond where the unit cell consists of two atoms.&nbsp;
<TT>BCC</TT> is used during the 
generation of Large Unit Cells using program MAKPOL&nbsp; 
and also used in <em>k</em>-space or Brillouin zone work using
program BZ.&nbsp; This applies only to layer and solid systems.  </P>
