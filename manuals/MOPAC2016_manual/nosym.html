<TT>NOSYM</TT> </h1>
<p>
By default, symmetry point-groups are
automatically assigned, and used in identifying the irreducible representations
of molecular orbitals, vibrations, and states, and in accelerating the
construction of the Hessian in FORCE calculations.</p>
<P>Sometimes a system almost has the symmetry of a point group higher than C<SUB>1</SUB>. Minor deviations from exact symmetry are allowed, but these
sometimes cause difficulties. If that happens, then the job will fail. To prevent this happening, the symmetry can be re-defined as C<SUB>1</SUB>. This effectively disables all the symmetry features, so some jobs, particularly <A HREF="force.html"><TT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U>FORCE</U></FONT></TT></A> calculations, will take longer to run. </P>
<P>Use <TT>NOSYM</TT> if there is any reason to suspect that the point-group symmetry features are causing problems. </P>
<P> A second type of symmetry can be used by specifying&nbsp; <TT><A HREF="symmetry.html"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">SYMMETRY</FONT></U></A></TT>.&nbsp;
This is distinct from the default of using the point-group of the system to
label irreducible representations and to accelerate <TT>FORCE</TT>
calculations. When <TT>SYMMETRY</TT> is used, the symmetry relations between
coordinates are defined by the user.&nbsp; These can be used for defining the
point-group of a molecule, for example the D<sub>6h</sub> of benzene, but no point-group
theory is used when <TT>SYMMETRY</TT> is specified.&nbsp;  </P>
