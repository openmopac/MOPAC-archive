<h1 class="auto-style1">File &lt;file&gt;.brz</h1>
<p class="auto-style2">A file of the type &lt;file&gt;.brz is written by MOPAC and 
read by BZ.&nbsp; It contains all the 
information needed for the construction of the Brillouin zone, and is not 
intended to be read by a user.&nbsp; However, for users who would like to 
examine this file, the following description of the contents&nbsp; is provided:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>First line (Four integers and the letter T or F)</h3>
<p>For electronic work, NORBS: Number of orbitals (one integer).&nbsp; for 
phonon work, 3*NATOMS. <br>
Number of mers in each direction (three integers)<br>
BCC (logical.&nbsp; &quot;T&quot; if BCC is present, &quot;F&quot; otherwise)</p>
<h3>Next block (A large number of real numbers)</h3>
<p>For electronic work, the Fock matrix, lower half triangle, (real, (NORBS*(NORBS+1))/2 
data); for phonon work, the mass-weighted Hessian (real, (NATOMS*3*(NATOMS*3+1))/2 
data), where NORBS = number of atomic orbitals in the system, and NATOMS = 
number of atoms in the system.)<br>
Translational vector lengths (9 real numbers) For a polymer, ignore the last six 
data, for a layer, ignore the last three data.</p>
<h3>Next block (Two integers, then more real numbers)</h3>
<p>Number of dimension (integer) If&nbsp; value = 1, then a polymer; if 2, then a 
layer, and if 3 then a solid.<br>
Number of atoms (integer)<br>
Cartesian coordinates (real, 3 times number of atoms)</p>
<h3>Next block (A large number of integers)</h3>
<p>For electronic work: the orbital counters (integer, 2 times number of atoms) 
These are the starting and ending orbital indices for each atom. For phonon 
work, the series: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, etc. or (i - 2, i, i = 1:(number of atoms)).&nbsp; 
These indicate the degrees of freedom associated with each atom.<br>

<h3><a name="How to make file.brz">How to make &lt;file&gt;.brz</a></h3>
<p>The file &lt;file&gt;.brz is generated when a MOPAC data set that contains keywords
<a href="mers.html"><TT>MERS</TT></a>, and possibly other keywords, is run. For electronics, any keywords 
except <a href="mozyme.html"><tt>MOZYME</tt></a> that 
result in a normal output, i.e., an output that includes the text &quot;FINAL HEAT OF 
FORMATION&quot; should also 
be present.&nbsp; For example, keywords such as <a href="force.html"><TT>FORCE</TT></a> 
and 
<a href="zero_scf.html"><tt>0SCF</tt></a> should not be present.&nbsp; For phonon work <a href="force.html"><TT>FORCE</TT></a> and
<a href="isotope.html"><TT>ISOTOPE</TT></a> or <a href="restart.html"><TT>RESTART</TT></a> should 
also be present. Keyword <TT>MERS</TT> should always be added by running
<a href="makpol.html">MAKPOL</a>, it should not be typed in &quot;by hand.&quot;</p>
