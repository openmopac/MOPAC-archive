<H2>Suggested procedure for locating bugs
</H2>
Users are supplied with the source code for MOPAC, and,  while  the original
code is fairly bug-free, after it has been modified there is a possibility that
bugs may have been introduced.  In these  circumstances the  author  of  the
changes  is obviously responsible for removing the offending bug, and the
following  ideas  might  prove  useful  in  this context.
<P>
First of all, and most important, before any modifications are done a  back-up
copy  of the standard MOPAC should be made.  This will prove invaluable in
pinpointing deviations from the  standard  working.   This point  cannot  be
over-emphasized--<EM>make  a  back-up before modifying MOPAC!</EM>
<P>
Clearly, a bug can occur almost  anywhere,  and  a  logical  search sequence is
necessary in order to minimize the time taken to locate it.
<P>
If possible, perform the debugging with a small molecule, in  order to  save
time  (debugging  is,  of  necessity,  time  consuming) and to minimize output.
<P>
The two sets of subroutines  in  MOPAC,  those  involved  with  the
electronics  and  those  involved  in  the geometrics, are kept strictly
separate, so the first question to be answered is which set contains the bug.
If the heats of formation, derivatives, I.P.s, and charges, etc., are correct,
the  bug  lies  in  the  geometrics;  if  faulty,  in  the electronics.

 Bugs discovered in the electronics subroutines</A>
</H3>
<p>Use formaldehyde for this test.  Use keywords <TT>1SCF</TT>, <TT>DEBUG</TT>, and
any others necessary. </p>
<P>
The main steps are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Check  the  starting  one-electron  matrix  and   two-electron integral
string, using the keyword <TT><a href="hcore.html">HCORE</a></TT>.  It is normally sufficient to verify
that the two hydrogen atoms  are  equivalent,  and  that  the
<span class="b">&pi;</span>
system
involves  only <I>p</I><SUB><I>z</I></SUB> on  oxygen  and carbon.  Note that numerical values are
not checked, but only relative values.
<P>
If an error is found, use <TT><a href="moldat.html">MOLDAT</a></TT> to verify the  orbital  character, etc.
<P>
If faulty the error lies in <TT>READMO</TT>, <TT>GETGEO</TT> or <TT>MOLDAT</TT>.
<P>
Otherwise the error lies in <TT>HCORE</TT>, <TT>H1ELEC</TT> or <TT>ROTATE</TT>.
<P>
If the starting matrices are correct, go on to step (2).
<P>
<DT>2.
<DD>Check the density or Fock matrix on every iteration,  with  the words
<TT><a href="fock.html">FOCK</a></TT> or <TT><a href="density.html">DENSITY</a></TT>.  Check the equivalence of the  two hydrogen
atoms, and the <span class="b">&pi;</span>
system, as in (1).
<P>
If an error is found, check the first Fock matrix.  If faulty,  the bug  lies
in ITER, probably in the Fock subroutines FOCK1 or FOCK2,  or in the (guessed)
density matrix (MOLDAT).  An exception is  in  the  UHF closed-shell
calculation,  where  a  small  asymmetry  is introduced to initiate the
separation of the <span class="b">&alpha;</span>
and <span class="b">&beta;</span>
UHF wavefunctions.
<P>
If no error is found, check the second Fock matrix.  If faulty, the error lies
in the density matrix DENSIT, or the diagonalization RSP.
<P>
If the Fock matrix is acceptable, check all the Fock matrices.   If the  error
starts in iterations 2 to 4, the error probably lies in CNVG, if after that, in
PULAY, if used.
<P>
If SCF is achieved, and the heat  of  formation  is  faulty,  check HELECT.
If C.I. was used check MECI.
<P>
If the derivatives are faulty, use <TT><a href="dcart.html">DCART</a></TT> to  verify  the  Cartesian
derivatives.   If  these  are  faulty, check DCART and DHC.  If they are
correct,  or  not  calculated,  check  the   DERIV   finite   difference
calculation.   If the wavefunction is non-variationally optimized, check
DERNVO.
<P>&nbsp;<H3><A NAME="SECTION001712200000000000000">Bugs discovered in the geometric subroutines</A> </H3>
<P>If the geometric calculation is faulty, use <TT><a href="flepo.html">FLEPO</a></TT> or <TT>
<a href="prnt.html">PRNT=5</a></TT> to monitor the optimization, <TT>
<a href="deriv.html">DERIV</a></TT> may also be useful here. </P>
<P>For the FORCE calculation, <TT><a href="dcart.html">DCART</a></TT> or <TT>DERIV</TT> are useful for variationally optimized functions, <TT>
<a href="compfg.html">COMPFG</a></TT> for non-variationally optimized functions. </P>
<P>For reaction paths, verify that FLEPO is working correctly; if so, then PATHS is faulty. </P>
<P>For saddle-point calculations, verify that FLEPO is working correctly; if so, then REACT1 is faulty. </P>
<P>Keep in mind the fact that MOPAC is a large calculation, and, while intended to be versatile, many combinations of options have not been tested. If a bug is found in the original code, please communicate details to Dr. James J. P.
