Three quantities can be derived&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="references.html#bonds">15</A>] from the density matrix for use in
discussing bonding.  These are: atomic bond index, anisotropy, and  bond
order.
<P>
The density matrix, <I>P</I>, can be decomposed into sub-matrices representing atoms
or interactions between atoms.  The three  quantities just mentioned can then
be defined in terms of these sub-matrices.
