The  Cartesian  derivatives  which  are  calculated  in DCART   for
variationally  optimized  systems  are  printed  if  the keyword <TT>DCART
</TT>is present.  The  derivatives  are  in  units  of  kcals/&Aring;ngstrom,  and
the coordinates are displacements in <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, and <I>z</I>.
<p>Only the derivatives of the closed-shell SCF wavefunction are printed, that 
is, any post-hoc corrections such as the effects of pressure, dispersion, etc. 
are not included at this point. To include the post-hoc corrections, add
<a href="deriv.html"><tt>DERIV</tt></a>.&nbsp; For the equivalent open-shell RHF gradients, see
<a href="dernvo.html"><TT>DERNVO</TT></a>.</p>
