<TT>NOREOR</TT>
</h1>
When the symmetry of a molecule is being worked out, the molecule is
orientated by default.  If <TT>NOREOR</TT> is specified, the molecule will
<EM>not</EM> be reorientated.  The main reason to not reorientate the molecule
is to allow a lower point-group to be used, and to allow the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> axes
in Abelian groups to be defined by the user.<p>When <a href="geo_ref.html"><tt>GEO_REF</tt></a> 
is used, the default is that the reference geometry is rotated and translated to 
give the maximum overlap with the data-set geometry. This operation will be 
suppressed when <TT>NOREOR</TT> is present.</p>
<p>In a <a href="force.html"><tt>FORCE</tt></a> calculation, <TT>NOREOR</TT> will prevent the molecules being reoriented to 
line up the moment of inertia axes with the Cartesian axes. </p>
