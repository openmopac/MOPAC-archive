<h1>Fault in PM6 in Prediction of Oxalic Acid geometry</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PM6 predicts the twisted conformation of oxalic acid (HOOC-COOH) to be 2.9 
kcal/mol lower in energy than the planar form, and B3LYP predicts the twisted 
form to be 1.4 kcal/mol higher than the planar form. There is no reason to doubt 
the B3LYP result, therefore PM6 has a definite error.</p>

<p>PM6 predicts crystalline 
oxalic acid to be composed of&nbsp; planar oxalic acid molecules, in 
agreement with X-Ray results.</p>
