Consider the data set for formaldehyde:<PRE> SYMMETRY
Formaldehyde
 
  O  0.0 0    0.0 0    0.0 0                     
  C  1.2 1    0.0 0    0.0 0  1  0  0       
  H  1.1 1  120.0 1    0.0 0  2  1  0       
  H  1.1 0  120.0 0  180.0 0  2  1  3       
 
   3  1    4
   3  2    4 </PRE>
The optimization flags for the first atom, oxygen, are all zero, because the system 
is in internal coordinates and translating the molecule would not alter its energy at all.<p>
For atom 2, carbon, the first coordinate, the C=O bond length, 1.2<font face="Times New Roman">&Aring;,</font> 
is flagged for optimization, the other two coordinates are not flagged for 
optimization, because there is no angle or dihedral.</p>
<p>Atom 3, hydrogen, has both the C-H bond length, 1.1<font face="Times New Roman">&Aring;, 
and the H-C=O angle, 120 degrees,</font> flagged for optimization.</p>
<p>Atom 4, also a hydrogen, has no coordinates marked for optimization, because 
the C-H and H-C=O parameters are <a href="symmetry.html">symmetry-defined</a> to 
be the same as those of atom 3, and the dihedral is exactly 180 degrees.&nbsp;

&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Only one reaction coordinate
is allowed, but this can be made more versatile  by the use of <TT>SYMMETRY</TT>.
Two methods of specifying the points to be used on the reaction coordinate are
allowed.   </p>
<h4>Using <a name="explicit_points">explicit points</a></h4>
<p>If the user wants to explicitly specify each point, then the values
of the reaction coordinate should  follow  immediately  after  the geometry  
and  any  symmetry  data.   No  terminator  is  required,  and free-format-type
input is acceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp; For each point calculated, this option produces 
an output that is similar to the normal MOPAC output for a geometry 
optimization.</p>
<h4>
Using a step-size</h4>
<P>
If the points to be used form a regular sequence, then the preferred method
of specifying them is by use of the two keywords <TT><a href="point.html">POINT=<I>n</I></a></TT> and <TT>
<a href="step.html">STEP=<I>n</I>.<I>nn</I></a></TT>.
For example, to rotate a torsion angle through 360<IMG

 SRC="img222.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">
in steps of 10<IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img223.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">,
the keywords <TT>POINT=36 STEP=10</TT> would be used.&nbsp; For each point 
calculated, this option produces an output that consists of the values of the 
variable and the heat of formation, and the geometry at that point, i.e., the 
output is much smaller than that of a normal geometry optimization.<h4>
Two-dimensional grid</h4>
<P>
If two "reaction coordinates" are used, then MOPAC assumes that  the
two-dimensional  space  in  the  region of the supplied geometry is to be
mapped.  The two dimensions to be mapped are in the plane defined by  the
"-1" labels. Step  sizes  in the two directions must be supplied using
<TT>STEP1</TT> and <TT>STEP2</TT> on the keyword line.
<P>
Using internal coordinates, the first atom has  three  unoptimizable
coordinates,  the second atom two, (the bond-length can be optimized) and the
third atom has one  unoptimizable  coordinate.   None  of  these  six
unoptimizable  coordinates  at the start of the geometry should be marked for
optimization.  If any are so marked, a  warning  is  given,  but  the
calculation will continue.
<P>
In Cartesian coordinates all parameters can be optimized.
<P>
In IRC/DRC calculations, the flag &quot;T&quot; specifies that turning points for the 
coordinate are to be printed, see <a href="DRC_coordinates.html">Dynamic and 
Intrinsic Reaction Coordinates</a> for more detail.
