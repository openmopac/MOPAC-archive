In the <TT>SADDLE</TT> calculation&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="references.html#saddle">18</A>], the distance between the two
geometries is steadily  reduced  until  the  transition  state  is located.
Sometimes, however, the user may want  to  alter  the  maximum  rate  at
which  the distance  between  the  two geometries reduces. BAR is a ratio,
normally 0.01, or 1 percent.  This represents a maximum rate of reduction of
the bar  of 1 percent per step.  Alternative values that might be considered
are <TT>BAR=0.005</TT> or <TT>BAR=0.001</TT>, although other values may  be  used.
See  also <TT><a href="saddle.html">SADDLE</a></TT>.
<P>
If CPU time is not a major consideration, use <TT>BAR=0.001</TT>.
