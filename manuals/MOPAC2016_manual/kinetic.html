<TT>KINETIC=<I>n</I>.<I>nnn</I></TT> </h1>
<P>In a DRC calculation <I>n</I>.<I>nnn</I> kcal/mol of excess kinetic energy is 
added to the system.&nbsp; At the start of a DRC calculation, the atoms are 
initially at rest.&nbsp; So kinetic energy cannot be added to the system.&nbsp; When 
KINETIC=n.nn is used, the DRC is first run for a few steps until the atoms have 
a significant velocity.&nbsp; This is when the kinetic energy amounts to 0.2 
kcal/mol.&nbsp; When that happens, the kinetic energy is increased suddenly by <i>
n.nn</i> kcal/mol.&nbsp; The next few steps will show errors in the output as the 
energy is added to the system.&nbsp; The use of 0.2 kcal/mol is arbitrary - any small 
number could be used.</P>
<P>If a system starts off with an energy of -100 kcal/mol, and KINETIC=10 is used, 
the DRC will be run with a total (kinetic plus potential) of -90 kcal/mol.</P>
<P>In an IRC=1 or IRC=-1 calculation, at the start of the run, the geometry is 
shifted by an amount proportional to <I>n</I>.<I>nnn. </I>Try using 20 to begin 
with, in the direction of the reaction normal coordinate. A sufficiently large 
value will ensure that the IRC will follow the correct path, but an excessively 
large value will distort the shape of the top of the reaction barrier.<br>
