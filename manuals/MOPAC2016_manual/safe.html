If MOPAC has been compiled so that the memory demand is minimized, then some
SCF convergers will not be available.  For well-behaved systems, this is not
a problem.  However, if there is difficulty in generating an SCF, then these
special SCF convergers may be needed.  To allow them to be used, specify
<TT>SAFE</TT>.
