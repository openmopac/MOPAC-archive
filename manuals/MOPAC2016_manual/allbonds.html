<P>When keyword <TT><a href="bonds.html"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U>BONDS</U></FONT></a></TT> is used in a <TT>
<a href="mozyme.html"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U>MOZYME</U></FONT></a></TT> calculation, only those bonds with bond orders greater than 0.01 and that do not involve hydrogen atoms are printed.  This is to reduce the size of the output.  When <TT>ALLBONDS</TT> is used, all bonds with bond orders greater than 0.001 are printed.  This includes bonds involving hydrogen atoms.</P>
<P> This prints the rotationally invariant bond order between atoms that are near to each other. In this context a bond is defined as the sum of the squares of the density matrix elements connecting any two atoms. For ethane, ethylene and acetylene the carbon-carbon bond orders are roughly 1.00, 2.00 and 3.00, respectively. See also&nbsp; <TT>

<P>Valencies are calculated from the atomic terms only and are defined as the sum of the bonds the atom makes with other atoms. </P>
