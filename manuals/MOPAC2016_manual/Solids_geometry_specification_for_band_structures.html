<H2>Geometry Specification for Band Structure Calculations
</H2>
Before electronic band structure calculations can be done, the sequence of
atoms in the polymer must be supplied in a highly specific order.  For a simple
polymer, the coordinates of all the atoms in the first fundamental unit cell
are given.  These atoms can be in any order.  The next set of atoms defined are
those for the next unit cell.  These atoms <EM>must</EM> be in the same order as
the atoms in the first unit cell. For band structures at least two unit cells
must be defined.  If more than two unit cells are defined, the atoms in the
other  unit cells must be defined in the same order as those in the first unit
cell.
<P>
For all polymer calculations <EM>except</EM> band structures, the order of
atoms is not important. <a href="tv.html">An example of such a data set</a>
is shown
for
polytetrahydrofuran.  When band structures are to be calculated,
<a href="tv.html">the order of atoms is important</a>.
<P>
Because of the difficulty in generating data sets for band-structure work,
program <TT>BZ</TT> was written.  Given a suitable data-set, BZ will generate a
MOPAC data set which can then be used for the calculation of band structures.
