        The active space for double excitations includes <i>n</i> M.O.s. If only
        <i>n</i> is specified, the <i>n</i> M.O.s which ‘bracket’ the 
        occupied-virtual energy levels are selected. (see C.I.=<i>n</i> for 
        details). In C.I.D.=(<i>n</i>,<i>m</i>), <i>n</i> is the number of M.O.s 
        in the active space, and <i>m</i> is the number of doubly filled (that 
        is, not empty or partially filled) levels to be used. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By default, if <a href="cisd.html"><tt>CISD</tt></a> is specified, 
an active space of 10 M.O.s (or the same active space as single excitations, if 
this is smaller) is used.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To generate double excitations, all single excitations 
specified by C.I. are generated. For each single excitation, all double 
excitations within the active space generated by C.I.D. are generated. For 
example, if C.I.=6, one of the single excitations is (HOMO-2, LUMO+2). If C.I.D.=2, 
this single excitation will be used to generate the double excitation (HOMO-2, 
HOMO, LUMO, LUMO+2), where both M.O.s involved in the second excitation are 
within the smaller active space specified by C.I.D., even though the original 
single excitation involves orbitals outside the C.I.D. active space. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For a  <tt>CISD</tt> calculation, the number of excitations that are 
generated is approximately:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(CI(m) * CI(n-m)) * (CID(m) * CID(n-m))</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even if the <a href="MAXCI.html"><tt>MAXCI</TT></a> keyword is used to limit the size of the 
CI matrix, generating and computing the energies of doubly excited electron 
configurations can become computationally expensive if a large active space for 
double excitations is used.</p>
