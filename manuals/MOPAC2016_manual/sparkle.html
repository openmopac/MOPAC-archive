<p align="left">The lanthanides can be represented by their fully ionized 3+&nbsp; 
sparkles.&nbsp; That is, they have no basis set, and therefore cannot have a 
charge different from +3.000.&nbsp; To use these sparkles, add keyword <TT>SPARKLE</TT>.</p>
<p align="left">See also <a href="sparkles.html">SPARKLES</a> These entities do 
not need keyword <TT>SPARKLE</TT>.</p>
<p align="left">If <TT>SPARKLE</TT> is present, and it's not needed, it will be 
ignored.</p>
<p align="left">The geometries of the lanthanides are reproduced with good 
accuracy, but the heats of formation and electronic properties are not accurate.</p>
<p align="left">To specify Dysprosium 3+ ion, use <TT>SPARKLE</TT>, and symbol Dy at the appropriate point in the Z-matrix.</p>
<h2 align="left">&quot;f&quot; Orbitals</h2>
<p align="left">Lanthanides 3+ ions have partially filled &quot;f&quot; shells, with the 
number of &quot;f&quot; electrons ranging from 0 (lanthanum) to 14 (lutetium).&nbsp; These 
electrons are important in the spectroscopy of Ln<sup>3+</sup> complexes, where 
their excited states are represented in the UV-Vis spectra by quite sharp lines.&nbsp; 
That the lines are quite sharp indicates that the &quot;f&quot; electrons do not 
contribute significantly to covalent bonding. Therefore, in semiempirical 
methods, lanthanide ions are represented by an unpolarizable core consisting of 
the nucleus, all the electrons up to Xenon, and zero or more &quot;4f&quot; electrons.&nbsp; 
Only Ln<sup>3+</sup> ions are available using the sparkle model, so the 
configurations used are La<sup>3+</sup>: [Xe]4f<sup>0</sup>; Ce<sup>3+</sup>: [Xe]4f<sup>1</sup>; 
... Lu<sup>3+</sup>: [Xe]4f<sup>14</sup>.&nbsp; Although not used in 
semiempirical theory, the ground states of these ions can be thought of as La<sup>3+</sup>: 
1S<sub>g</sub>; Ce<sup>3+</sup>: 2F<sub>u</sub>; Pr<sup>3+</sup>: 3H<sub>g</sub>; 
Nd<sup>3+</sup>: 4I<sub>g</sub>; ... Gd<sup>3+</sup>: 8S<sub>u</sub>;... Lu<sup>3+</sup>: 
1S<sub>g</sub>, but for computational convenience the ground states should be 
regarded as undefined, simply [Xe] plus zero, one, two or more &quot;f&quot; electrons. 
For this reason, when modeling Ln<sup>3+</sup> complexes, ignore the atomic 
configuration of the Ln<sup>3+</sup> ions, instead pay attention only to the 
electronic state of the rest of the system.&nbsp; For most simple organics, such 
as
<a href="../PM7_accuracy/data_molecules/La(III)O8%20(AQACAL)_Jmol.html">
lanthanum trisacetylacetonate</a>, CSD entry AQACAL, this will be the Singlet; 
almost all others will be Doublets.&nbsp; For these sets, explicit keywords are 
not needed - they will be automatically recognized by default.&nbsp; Only for 
exotic systems, such as Triplet or excited states would keywords defining the 
state be needed.</p>
