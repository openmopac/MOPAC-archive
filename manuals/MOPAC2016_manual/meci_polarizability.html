<H3>Polarizability
</H3>
The expectation value of the polarization operator is given under
"POLARIZABILITY." This is an approximation to the transition moment
for the absorption or emission of a photon.  One of the two states
involved is the state defined by the keywords.  By default, this is the
ground state, but might be an excited state, for example if
