<TT>REORTH</TT> 
</H2>
During a <TT><a href="mozyme.html">MOZYME</a> </TT>run, the steady accumulation of small errors (for example,
roundoff, and more important, the elimination of atoms from LMOs) will
result in the LMOs becoming non-orthogonal.  These errors can be eliminated
almost completely by re-orthogonalizing the LMOs.  If <TT>REORTH</TT>
is present, then the LMOs will be re-orthogonalized at the end of every 10th SCF 
calculation, starting with the first SCF.
<p>In practice, a better strategy is to allow the job to run for ~500 cycles or 
1-2 CPU days, then shut it down and restart it using <a href="restart.html">
<tt>RESTART</tt></a>, but without using keyword <a href="oldens.html"><tt>OLDENS</tt></a>.&nbsp; 
That will cause the LMO's to be recalculated, and job to resume starting with 
the geometry at the end of the previous run.</p>
