<H2>Lewis Structures.
</H2>
One of the more difficult operations involved in using localized molecular
orbitals is the generation of a Lewis structure.  While this operation is
almost trivially easy for a competent chemist, setting up the instructions so
that a program can do the same operation has proved to be a daunting task.
<P>
In the following section, the steps involved in calculating the Lewis structure
are described.  This description is intended to be definitive, in the sense
that it should allow the Lewis structure for <EM>any</EM> common compound to be
generated. At the same time, any deficiency in the description should be
reflected in the inability of MOZYME to generate the Lewis structure for
certain systems.
<P>
Because of its complexity, the main sequence involved will be given first,
followed by a more detailed explanation of the individual steps.

Hydrogen atoms are monovalent. Because of this, they can only bond to one other atom. Therefore, the first set of bonds formed are the X-H
<i>&sigma;</i>bonds. The criterion used is that each hydrogen atom is connected to the atom nearest to it, except that a hydrogen atom is not allowed to be bonded to another hydrogen atom. </DD>
<DD dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The connectivity of all other atoms is determined. Atoms are considered as being connected (bonded together) if the interatomic distance is less than 110% of the sum of their Van der Waals radii. </DD>
<DD dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Any bridging hydrogen bonds are identified. These usually indicate a faulty geometry. If any are present, then the SCF calculation will not be run, unless <TT>
<a href="let.html">LET</a></TT> is present. </DD>
<DD dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Any user-defined chemical bonds are identified. This is useful in 
cases where a Lewis structure could not otherwise be created. </DD>
<DD dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<div dir="ltr">
<DT dir="ltr"><i><span class="b"><strong>&sigma;</strong></span></i><strong>-framework
</strong> </DT>
</div>
<DD dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp; <BR>
This is the simplest set of bonds to identify. A <i>&sigma;</i> bond exists for every pair of atoms that are connected. The number of <i>&sigma;</i> bonds is equal to the number of connections in the system. For water, this would be 
2; for benzene, 12; and for ethylene, 5. </DD>
<DD dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Each time a bond is formed, the number of available atomic orbitals on the atoms involved is decremented by 1 and the number of available electrons is decremented by 1. For example, before the <i>&sigma;</i> framework 
of ammonia is formed, the number of available orbitals on nitrogen is 4 and the number of electrons is 5. After the <i>&sigma;</i> bonds are formed, there is 1 orbital and 2 electrons left. </DD>
<p dir="ltr">The number of&nbsp; <i>&sigma;</i> bonds or connections in a single 
molecular system is equal to (N&nbsp; + R - 1) where N is the number of atoms in 
the system and R is the number of rings.&nbsp; Thus ethyl acetate, CH<sub>3</sub>COO(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), 
has14 atoms and no rings, so it has 13 connections or 13 <i>&sigma;</i> bonds. 
Within proteins, the residues His, Phe, Try, and Pro each have one ring, Trp has 
two, all the rest have zero.&nbsp; So given the total number of atoms and the 
residue sequence, it is quite easy to work out the number of sigma bonds. 
Topologically, most proteins are chains, but if cysteine bonds are present, each 
bond counts as a ring.<STRONG><div dir="ltr">
  <DT dir="ltr">Lone pairs</STRONG> </DT>
</div>
<DD dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp; <BR>
The next set of Lewis elements formed are the lone pairs. The rule used here is that if there are more electrons than orbitals on an atom, the extra electrons are used in the construction of lone pairs. Each lone pair uses up two electrons and one orbital. Thus, one lone pair would be assigned to the nitrogen in ammonia, two lone pairs would be assigned to oxygen in water, and three lone pairs would be assigned to chlorine in HCl. </DD>
<DD dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The lone pairs could only assigned after the <i>&sigma;</i> bonds were created. If they were assigned before the
<i>&sigma;</i> bonds, then some ionic systems, such as NH<SUB>4</SUB><sup>+</sup>, could not be represented. </DD>
<STRONG>
<div dir="ltr">
  <DT dir="ltr">Open-ended <span class="b">&pi;</span>-bonds</STRONG> </DT>
</div>
<DD dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp; <BR>
Once the lone pairs are assigned, the number of unused atomic orbitals on an atom will be equal to the number of unused electrons on that atom. 
These unused orbitals are then available for forming multiple bonds between atoms. If two atoms, that are <i>&sigma;</i> bonded together, both have unused orbitals, then they can form a
<i>&pi;</i>bond. </DD>
<DD dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The order in which
<i>&pi;</i> bonds are generated is important. If in styrene, for example, a
<i>&pi;</i> bond is assigned to the ring-C<SUB>1</SUB> as in Figure 1, <I>A</I>, then when the remaining double bonds are created, there are two unused atomic orbitals on atoms that are not bonded together. In order for a Lewis structure to be generated, two electrons are put into one of these unused orbitals, creating an anionic center, and no electrons are put into the other orbital, making it a cationic center. </DD>

<p dir="ltr">The order in which the

<p dir="ltr">Also, if both ends of the olefinic group are connected to aromatic rings, as in stilbene, then identification of the olefin group is not obvious. </DD>
<DD dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">To allow for this, the following two rules are used: </DD>
<div dir="ltr">
<DT dir="ltr">1. Where there is the possibility of forming a triple bond, do so. </DT>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<DT dir="ltr">2. When a delocalized

<i>&pi;</i> bond formed should involve atoms that are
<i>&pi;</i> bonded to exactly two other atoms. </DT>
</div>

<P dir="ltr">In the case of stilbene (<IMG SRC="img1086.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=29 ALT="$phi$">-CH=CH-<IMG SRC="img1087.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=29 ALT="$phi$">), this prevents a
<i>&pi;</i> bond forming between the ring and a carbon atom of the olefin. </P>
<P dir="ltr">Whenever a delocalized
<i>&pi;</i> system is encountered, as soon as a
<i>&pi;</i> bond is formed and the delocalization destroyed, then the rest of the
<i>&pi;</i> system is treated as a simple conjugated polyene. This ensures that the maximum number of
<i>&pi;</i> bonds is formed, and prevents unconnected
<i>&pi;</i> bonds from being created. Thus benzene would have the three
<i>&pi;</i> bonds: C<SUB>1</SUB>-C<SUB>2</SUB>, C<SUB>3</SUB>-C<SUB>4</SUB>, and C<SUB>5</SUB>-C<SUB>6</SUB>, and not the quinoidal C<SUB>1</SUB>-C<SUB>2</SUB>and C<SUB>4</SUB>-C<SUB>5</SUB> bonds. </P>
<P dir="ltr">To allow compounds that contain several fused delocalized
<i>&pi;</i>-systems, such as the higher buckyballs (specifically, C<SUB>960</SUB>) to be modeled, two extra rules are needed. These rules can be regarded as minor qualifications to the earlier rules: </P>
<DL dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">
<DT dir="ltr">1. If any atoms attached to an open-ended <i>&pi;</i> system belong to a delocalized
<i>&pi;</i> system, then when delocalized <i>&pi;</i> systems are opened, the opening is done using these atoms. </DT>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<DT dir="ltr">2. If a five-membered <i>&pi;</i> ring is attached to another delocalized
<i>&pi;</i> system, then when the
<i>&pi;</i> system is opened, at least one atom must be in the other delocalized system. </DT>
</div>
</DL>
<P dir="ltr">The effect of the first rule is that as soon as a graphitic network is encountered, all the
<i>&pi;</i> bonds in the network are assigned in one pass. Without this rule, individual parts of the network could be assigned separately, and at the junctions of the various domains, the potential for isolated
<i>&pi;</i> orbitals exists. This would lead to charges that would cause severe problems with the SCF calculation. </P>

<p dir="ltr">1.&nbsp; If a six-membered ring has two

<P dir="ltr">The effect of these rules is that when a graphitic lattice is encountered, all the atoms in the 
lattice will be assigned in such a way as to maximize the number of aromatic rings. An example of such a system is provided by the 
large icosahedral fullerene C<SUB>1500</SUB>. A facet of this system is shown in Figure 3. </P>



<STRONG>
Remaining unused atomic orbitals</STRONG>

All that remains is to identify any unused electrons and orbitals and to assign 
them to either the occupied or virtual sets.&nbsp; A general set of rules 
applies to all elements except carbon.&nbsp; For carbon, the rules are as 
follows:

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><b>Rules for carbon:</b>&nbsp; 
If there are two unused valence electrons, then the atom will be neutral (a carbene, 
for example). Otherwise, if the first or second nearest neighboring atom is of 
Group&nbsp;6, then the atom is assigned a negative charge; if the first or second 
nearest neighboring atom is of Group&nbsp;5, then the atom is assigned a positive 
charge. If the charge is still not determined, then the assignment of charge is 
deferred until all other atoms have been assigned. At that point, the charge is 
assigned as either +1 or -1, depending on the calculated charge on the system 
and the charge supplied by the data set. The charges are assigned so that the 
calculated charge equals the supplied charge.

<p dir="ltr" align="left"><b>Transition states</b><p dir="ltr" align="left">In a 
transition state, the coordination number of an atom might temporarily increase 
above that normally encountered.&nbsp; In a proton migration, for example, a hydrogen 
atom might briefly be bonded to two atoms.&nbsp; The easiest way to construct 
the Lewis structure for such systems is to simply ignore the increased 
coordination.&nbsp; Thus, in the case of a proton migration, at the transition 
state geometry the hydrogen atom is considered as bonding to one atom and not 
connected to the other atom.&nbsp; As with other structures of this general 
type, during the SCF calculation the correct bonds will be formed.<p dir="ltr" align="left"><b>General rules for all other elements:</b><p dir="ltr" align="left">
First, the oxidation state is determined.&nbsp; This is the sum of the 
calculated formal charge (if any) plus the number of bonds times -1 if the 
element is normally electronegative .&nbsp; For oxygen in CH<sub>3</sub>-O this 
would be 0 (from the current charge on oxygen) plus the number of bonds (here 1, 
to the carbon atom) times -1. This would give the formal oxidation state of 
minus one.&nbsp; If the calculated valence is less than that expected for a 
normal-valent system, a hypervalent valency will be tried.<p dir="ltr" align="left">
Then the calculated oxidation state (in CH<sub>3</sub>-O this would be -1 ) is 
compared with that expected (for oxygen, -2).&nbsp; If they are different, then 
electrons are added or removed as necessary to match the expected oxidation 
state.&nbsp; For the CH<sub>3</sub>-O system, one electron is added to give [CH<sub>3</sub>-O]<sup>-</sup>.&nbsp;

<p dir="ltr" align="left">All remaining electrons are used in making lone pairs.<p dir="ltr" align="left">
If there are any unused orbitals, they are used in making virtual lone pairs.<p dir="ltr" align="left">
Only limited hypervalent states are allowed.&nbsp; For chlorine, these are 1 and 
3, for iodine: 1, 3, and 7.&nbsp; The most popular states are used.&nbsp; Only 
those oxidation states that can result in closed shells are allowed, so Cr is 
Cr(II), Cr(III) is not allowed, nor is Fe(III).<p dir="ltr" align="left">
For some transition metals, the maximum coordination number is limited to five.&nbsp; 
This is necessary in order to allow some transition metal complexes such as [Ni<sup>ii</sup>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> 
to be modeled.&nbsp; Ni has a basis set of 4s(2), 4p(0), 3d(8), or 9 atomic 
orbitals and 10 electrons.&nbsp; The ion Ni<sup>2+</sup> has 9 atomic orbitals 
and 8 electrons. When Ni<sup>2+</sup> formed a <span class="b">&sigma;</span> bond 
with a nitrogen atom it would gain two electrons from each nitrogen atom as the 
lone pair on nitrogen donated two electrons to the bond.&nbsp; At the same time, 
the nitrogen atom would acquire a formal charge of +1.&nbsp; The result would be 
that in the nickel hexammonium complex, the nickel would formally gain 12 
electrons when it formed&nbsp; the six&nbsp; <span class="b">&sigma;</span> bonds.&nbsp; 
This results in the nickel atom having 8 electrons from Ni<sup>2+ </sup>plus 12 
electrons from the six nitrogen atoms, to give a total of 20 electrons in 9 
atomic orbitals.&nbsp; This is obviously impossible, so to avoid this 
catastrophe the maximum coordination number allowed for Ni is set to five. <p dir="ltr" align="left"><b>
Limitations or examples of difficult systems include:</b><p dir="ltr" align="left">
Chlorate ion, [ClO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>-</sup>&nbsp; chlorine forms three sigma 
bonds with the oxygen atoms, so its valency is +3.&nbsp; The first hypervalent 
state of chlorine is Cl(III), so this is used.&nbsp; Each oxygen has an 
oxidation state of -1, and therefore is given an extra electron to equal the 
expected oxidation state of -2.&nbsp; At this point, the calculated total charge 
is -3.&nbsp; In order to get the correct charge of -1, an artificial bond needs 
to be created between two of the oxygen atoms.&nbsp; There is no way to by-pass 
Cl(III) and use the correct Cl(V).<p dir="ltr" align="left">A very difficult set 
is: NH<sub>3</sub>, [NH<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, [PCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, 
[PCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup>, PF<sub>5</sub>, [PF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>-</sup>.&nbsp;

<p dir="ltr" align="left">Another difficult set is NH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>=CH-NH-CH=CH<sub>2</sub>, 
pyridinium ([C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N]<sup>+</sup>)&nbsp; In this set, the 
charge on the nitrogen only becomes obvious when the distant atoms are known.<p dir="ltr" align="left">
N-methyl 4 hydroxy pyridine (Me-NC5H4-O):&nbsp; Should this hypothetical system 
have a Zwitterion or the benzoquinone-like structure?<p dir="ltr" align="left">
Should the benzoquinone structure be charged (as in the di-anion of 
hydroquinone) or uncharged (as in benzoquinone).

<p dir="ltr" align="left">These few examples illustrate the difficulty of 
writing rules for generating Lewis structures for all possible organic systems.&nbsp; 
In an attempt to resolve ambiguities, the option exists to assign charges to 
individual atoms.</dl>
