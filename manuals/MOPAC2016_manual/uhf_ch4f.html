By default, UHF CH<sub>4</sub> plus F generates an excited state</h1>
<p align="left">
In general, SCF calculation involving halogen atoms that are far from neutral 
organic molecules give rise to electronic excited states.&nbsp; An example would 
be a fluorine atom about 10 Angstroms from a methane molecule.&nbsp; In this 
system (see data set below), the fluorine atom should have one unpaired extra 
alpha electron, and methane should be neutral.&nbsp; Instead, the SCF results in 
the fluorine atom having one unpaired beta electron and methane has two unpaired 
alpha electrons.&nbsp; What went wrong?&nbsp; The problem was traced to the 
initial guess for the density matrix.&nbsp; In the first few iterations of the 
SCF calculation, fluorine has a unit negative charge.&nbsp; The odd alpha 
electron goes on to the methane.&nbsp; As the SCF forms, a second alpha electron 
goes on to the methane; this results in the excited state forming.</p>
