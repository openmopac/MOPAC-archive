<p dir="ltr">The Ramachandra angles &phi;, &psi;, and &omega; for residues in a protein are printed.&nbsp; 
In the output the names of these angles are &quot;Phi&quot;, &quot;Psi&quot;, and &quot;Omega&quot; </p>

<p>An estimate of the accuracy of prediction of the peptide twist angle &omega; can 
be obtained by comparing the calculated PM7 twist angles with those found in PDB 
structures.&nbsp; A set of 2833 peptide bonds found in ten proteins deposited in 
the PDB in March 2021 was used in making this comparison.&nbsp; The histogram of 
the difference between the calculated and observed torsion angles is shown in 
the chart. To see the raw data, download <a href="Ramachandran%20angles.zip">
Ramachandran</a>. As expected, the calculated torsion angles are more often less 
than that observed, as can be seen at -10 and 10 degrees difference.</p>
