<TT>CISD</TT>
</h1>
In configuration interaction calculations, the ground state and  all
microstates resulting from single and double  electron excitations are used
if <TT>CISD</TT> is specified.  (Read <TT>CISD</TT> as Configuration Interaction
Singles and Doubles.)
<p>The number of states considered in a CISD C.I. involving <i>n</i>
doubly-occupied M.O.s and <i>m</i> empty M.O.s is:</p>
<p>No. of States = 1 + 2.n.m&nbsp; + (n.m)<sup>2</sup> + (n(n-1).m(m-1))/2</p>
<p>This represents: </p>
<p>Ground state <br>
+ (one <span class="b">&alpha;</span> electron excited + one <span class="b">&beta;</span>
electron excited) <br>
+ (one <span class="b">&alpha;</span> electron and one <span class="b">&beta;</span>
electron excited) <br>
+ (two <span class="b">&alpha;</span> electrons excited + two &beta; electrons excited) </p>
<p>The first term represents the ground state, the second term represents number
of one-electron excitations, and the third and fourth terms represent the number
of two-electron excitations.</p>
