<TT>UHF</TT>
</h1>
        The unrestricted Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is to be used.
<p>This is the default for odd-electron (radical) systems because geometry optimization 
using UHF runs faster than when <TT>RHF</TT> is used.&nbsp; This is because the open-shell RHF gradient
calculation is relatively slow.</p>
<p>If UHF methods are to be used on even electron systems, add keyword <TT>UHF</TT>.</p>
<p>A limitation of the <TT>UHF</TT> method is that the resulting wavefunction is not
spin quantized, that is, although &lt;S<sub>z</sub>&gt; has a&nbsp; well-defined
value, e.g. 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, etc., &lt;S<sup>2</sup>&gt; is normally not quantized.&nbsp;
For a system with an &lt;S<sub>z</sub>&gt; of 1/2, the &lt;S<sup>2</sup>&gt; should be 3/4 =
1/2*(1/2+1), but is usually higher.&nbsp; This is a consequence of spin
contamination.&nbsp; Spin contamination is not present if <TT>UHF</TT> is not used.</p>
