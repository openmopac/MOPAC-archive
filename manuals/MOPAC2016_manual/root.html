        In a configuration interaction calculation, a specific state can be 
requested by specifying the state name and the quantum number of that state.&nbsp; 
The lowest state of each type has the quantum number 1, the next is 2 and so on.&nbsp; 
To see the quantum numbers and state names, run a 1SCF calculation for the 
desired configuration interaction.&nbsp; The normal way to define the C.I. is to 
use the keywords <A HREF="ci=n.html"><TT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U>C.I.=<I>n</I></U></FONT></TT></A>. 
and <a href="meci.html"><tt>MECI</tt></a> (to print out the state information).
        Two ways of defining the desired state are provided:  <TT>ROOT=<i>n</i></TT>, where<i> n</i> is an integer, and
<TT>ROOT=<i>n</i>&lt;text&gt;</TT>, where <i>n</i> is an integer and &lt;text&gt; is a text string.<p>  <TT>
ROOT=</TT>n</p>
<p>The  <I>n</I>'th  root  of  a  C.I. calculation  is  to  be  used  in   the
   calculation.   If  a  keyword  specifying the spin-state is also present,
   e.g.  <TT>SINGLET</TT> or <TT>TRIPLET</TT>, then the  <I>n</I>'th  root  of  that  state  will  be
   selected.   Thus  <TT>ROOT=3</TT>  and <TT>SINGLET</TT> will select the third singlet root.
   If <TT>ROOT=3</TT> is used on its own, then the third root will be used, 
regardless of the states' name.&nbsp; This might be a triplet, the third singlet, or the second singlet (the second 
root might be a triplet). If the state selected is degenerate, all components of 
that state will be selected. </p>
<p>  <TT>ROOT=</TT>n&lt;text&gt;</p>
<p>  The  <I>n</I>'th root of a C.I. calculation that has the symmetry &lt;text&gt; is
to be used in the calculation.&nbsp; If a keyword specifying the spin-state is
also present, e.g.  <TT>SINGLET</TT> or <TT>TRIPLET</TT>, then the  <I>n</I>'th  root  of  that  state
that has the symmetry &lt;text&gt; will  be
   selected.   Thus, in an octahedral system, <TT>ROOT=3T2g</TT>  and <TT>SINGLET</TT> will select the third singlet
T2g root.
   If <TT>ROOT=3T2g</TT> is used without any spin-state being specified, then
the third T2g root will be used, regardless of spin. If the state selected is
degenerate, all components of that state will be selected. </p>

To see how these different forms behave, consider the following states of a d<sup>6</sup>
transition metal complex:<PRE>STATE	Q.N.	 Spin	  Symmetry
 1	 1	TRIPLET	    T2g
 4	 1	SINGLET     A1g
 5	 1	SINGLET	    T2g
 8	 1	TRIPLET	    T1g
11	 1	QUINTET	    T1g
14	 1	SEPTET	    A1g
15	 1	QUINTET	    T2g
18	 2	TRIPLET	    T1g
21	 3	TRIPLET	    T1g
24	 2	SINGLET	    T2g
27	 2	TRIPLET     T2g
30	 1	TRIPLET	    A2g
31	 1	SINGLET	    T1g
34	 3	TRIPLET	    T2g
37	 4	TRIPLET	    T1g
40	 1	TRIPLET	    Eg
42	 2	SINGLET	    T1g
45	 1	SINGLET	    Eg
47	 1	QUINTET     Eg</PRE>

<TT>ROOT=14</TT> would select the 14th state, the 1<sup>7</sup>A<sub>1g</sub> state. No
spin being specified, <TT>ROOT</TT> applies to the STATE column.<P>
<TT>ROOT=7</TT> and <TT>QUINTET</TT> would select the 47th and 48th states, the 1<sup>5</sup>E<sub>g </sub>&nbsp;state.
This is the 7th quintet state, the states 1-6 being T1g, T1g, T1g, T2g, T2g,
and T2g. That these states are degenerate is not important, because
<TT>ROOT=n</TT> specifies the n'th state, without regard to symmetry.
<P>
<TT>ROOT=2T2g</TT> and <TT>TRIPLET</TT> would select the 27th, 28th, and 29th states, the 2<sup>3</sup>T<sub>2g</sub>
state. This is the preferred method of specifying states. When  <TT>ROOT=</TT>n&lt;text&gt;
is used then the state specified will not change if the state moves up or down
the list of states. If the system has no symmetry,
<TT>ROOT=<i>n</i>A</TT> can be used.<P>
When a geometry is to be optimized, symmetry should be used, if present.&nbsp;
This is particularly important in octahedral transition metal complexes. If the
state has orbital degeneracy, e.g. if it is of type E, T, G, or H, then Jahn-Teller
effects might cause a loss of symmetry. High symmetry is automatically detected,
so, if present, it will be conserved. However, during a normal unconstrained
geometry optimization, minor excursions from high symmetry are allowed, and
these might confuse the high-symmetry detector.&nbsp; To prevent this, use
symmetry.&nbsp; In the case of a simple octahedral complex, MX<sub>6</sub>, the data set
might look like this:<P>
