Print out details of the <TT><a href="cosmo.html">COSMO</a></TT> surface to a
file called &lt;file&gt;.cos.&nbsp; Quantities printed include the solvent accessible
surface area, per atom, and the segment that make up the SAS. </p>
<p>
In addition to the heat of formation, other solvent-related properties are 
printed.&nbsp; Among these are the TOTAL COSMO CHARGE; this is 
the total COSMO polarization charge on the surface of the solute, i.e., it is 
approximately equal to the negative of the total solute charge.&nbsp; For 
detailed information, see p.140 of &quot;COSMO-RS: From Quantum Chemistry to Fluid 
Phase Thermodynamics and Drug Design&quot;, by Andreas Klamt, COSMOlogic GmbH&amp;CoKG, 
Leverkusen, Germany.&nbsp; Publisher: Elsevier, 2005</p>
<p>
The points on the SAS are printed; these can then be used with a graphics
package to give a pictorial representation of the SAS.</p>
<p>
As an example, when <TT>
<a href="nspa.html">NSPA</a></TT>=122 is used with a single atom, the set of points represented by
the following picture is generated:

quadrupole can be supplied by <a href="coscch.html">COSCCH</a>. </p>
