MOZYME example: </B>Constrained optimization of Crambin biased towards 1CBN</h1>
<p align="left">
X-ray structures frequently have errors that can be corrected by a constrained 
geometry optimization using keyword <a href="geo_ref.html"><TT>GEO_REF</TT></a>. 
In this example, the 1CBN X-ray structure is improved using PM6.&nbsp; Two data 
sets are needed.&nbsp; One data set, &quot;Crambin_X-ray_geometry.mop&quot; holds the 
X-ray geometry.&nbsp; This is the reference that will be used by the constrained 
optimization.&nbsp; The other data set, 
&quot;Constrained_Crambin_1CBN_optimization.mop&quot; holds the geometry that will be 
optimized.&nbsp; In this case, the geometry is identical to the X-ray structure.</p>
