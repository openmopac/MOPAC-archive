<TT>MINI</TT><sup>&Dagger;</sup></h1>
When very large molecules such as enzymes are modeled, the output can become 
very large.&nbsp; To reduce this, use <TT>MINI</TT>.&nbsp; When <TT>MINI</TT> is 
present, only atoms whose coordinates are flagged with a &quot;2&quot; will be printed.&nbsp; 
During a run, atoms flagged with a &quot;2&quot; will be handled as if they were 
flagged with a &quot;1&quot;.&nbsp; That is, the flag &quot;2&quot; will indicate an atom that is 
marked for optimization. For reaction paths, the reaction coordinate is normally &quot;-1&quot;, if&nbsp; <TT>MINI</TT> 
is present then the reaction coordinate can be &quot;-1&quot; or &quot;-2&quot; (&quot;-2&quot; is obviously 
more likely). Although <TT>MINI</TT> works with all types of calculation, the main use 
would be for calculations that involve reaction paths and IRC paths.&nbsp;<p>
<TT>MINI</TT> 
is also useful when animations are involved, for example mapping out a reaction 
path or following an IRC or DRC.&nbsp;&nbsp; If <a href="html.html"><tt>HTML</tt></a> is 
present, then a HTML document will be created that can be run using Firefox.&nbsp; If <tt><a href="graph.html">GRAPHF</a> </tt>is present in runs that 
produce animations then a file, &lt;file&gt;.xyz, will be generated.&nbsp; This can 
be visualized using Jmol.</p>
<p>When <TT>MINI</TT> and <TT><a href="ts.html">TS</a></TT> are both present, a 
transition state optimization calculation is run, and only atoms that are 
flagged with the symbol &quot;2&quot; will be 
printed; their positions will be changed during the optimization run. All nearby atoms that are to be moved during the optimization should be flagged with a 
&quot;1&quot;, these atoms will not be printed.&nbsp; More distant atoms should be flagged with &quot;0&quot; to 
indicate that their positions are fixed (frozen); they will not be printed.</p>
<p><TT>MINI</TT> and <a href="force.html"><TT>FORCETS</TT></a> can be used with 
internal or Cartesian coordinates.&nbsp; There are two ways to run <TT>MINI</TT> 
- <TT>FORCETS</TT> jobs:</p>
<p>(A) Running <TT>MINI</TT> and <TT>FORCETS</TT> in one job; this is not 
recommended for large systems. Use keywords <tt>HTML FORCETS <a href="irc.html">IRC</a> MINI</tt>&nbsp; 
plus others, to suit.&nbsp; Set optimization flags to &quot;2&quot; for the atoms to be 
used in <tt>FORCETS</tt>, and to &quot;0&quot; for all other atoms.&nbsp; </p>
<p>(B) Running <TT>MINI</TT> and <TT>FORCETS</TT> in two jobs; this is the 
recommended method for large systems.&nbsp; In the first job, use keywords <tt>
FORCETS <a href="isotope.html">ISOTOPE</a></tt> 
plus any others needed.&nbsp; Set optimization flags to &quot;1&quot; for the atoms to be 
used in <tt>FORCETS</tt>, and to &quot;0&quot; for all other atoms.&nbsp; In a second job, use 
keywords <tt>HTML FORCETS IRC MINI <a href="restart.html">RESTART</a></TT> plus others to suit. Use the 
same geometry plus flags as in the first job.&nbsp; To add an atom to the set of 
atoms printed, change its optimization flags from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;2&quot;.&nbsp; This gives 
increased flexibility in that the atoms used in the <tt>FORCETS </tt>calculation need to 
be as few as possible, because the <tt>FORCETS </tt>calculation is CPU intensive, but 
increasing the number of atoms printed in the <tt>IRC </tt>calculation only affects the 
files generated.</p>
<p>When <TT>MINI</TT> and <tt><a href="zero_scf.html">0SCF</a> </tt>are both present 
then a file, &lt;file&gt;.xyz, will 
be generated.</p>
<p> <TT>MINI</TT> is useful when locating transition states, in <TT>FORCETS</TT> 
calculations, in following reaction paths, and in <a href="irc.html"><TT>IRC</TT></a> 
and <a href="drc.html"><TT>DRC</TT></a> trajectories.</p>
<p> If <tt><a href="pdbout.html">PDBOUT</a></tt> is present, a PDB file will also be written; this file will be 
complete.&nbsp; So if a complete geometry is wanted, as well as the minimized 
geometry, then add <tt>PDBOUT</tt>.&nbsp; </p>
