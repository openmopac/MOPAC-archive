        In some instances, the default <a href="Lewis_structures.html">Lewis 
structure</a> used in a <a href="mozyme.html"><TT>MOZYME</TT></a> calculation is not 
correct.&nbsp; The correct structure can be selected by explicitly supplying one 
or more <span class="b">&pi;</span> bonds.&nbsp; To do this, add keyword <TT>SETPI</TT> or <TT>SETPI=&lt;file&gt;.TXT</TT>.&nbsp; 
When <TT>SETPI</TT> is used, after the data set add&nbsp; the atom-pairs, see <a href="atom_numbers.html">
atom numbering</a>, that define one or more
<span class="b">&pi;</span> bonds.&nbsp; For example, a hexagon of carbon atoms 
with four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms in the 1 and 4 positions, i.e. C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 
can either be  the neutral molecule <i>para</i>-benzoquinone or the di-anion 
of hydroquinone.&nbsp; The default Lewis structure is the neutral system.&nbsp; 
If the di-anion is wanted, then the three aromatic <span class="b">&pi;</span> 
bonds need to be explicitly defined, thus:<PRE>Mozyme setpi charge=-2 
  Di-anion of hydroquinone

<p>If the geometry is supplied using GEO_DAT, then <TT>SETPI</TT> cannot be 
used.&nbsp; Instead use <TT>SETPI=&lt;file&gt;.TXT, </TT>for example, setpi=setpi_for_Cytochrome-P450.txt 
or setpi=&quot;../setpi for Cytochrome-P450.txt. In this example, the keyword points 
to a file in the next-higher level.&nbsp; The file pointed to by setpi should 
contain exactly the same data as defined earlier.</p>
<p>When large biomolecules are being run, defining atoms by their atom number is 
sometimes difficult.&nbsp; In a PDB atom label, the number may or may not be the 
same as the atom number.&nbsp; Two simpler methods for defining atoms are 
provided: the PDB label and the JSmol label.&nbsp; If the PDB or JSmol label is 
used, then enclose the label in quotation marks. Wildcards, where the chain 
letter is replaced by an asterisk, or a residue is replaced by three asterisks, 
are allowed. The first occurrence that matches will be used. Examples of valid labels are:</p>

<p>There is no need to supply all the <span class="b">&pi;</span> bonds, only 
those necessary to resolve any ambiguities.&nbsp; Other examples of the need 
for <TT>SETPI</TT> include:<img src="Guanine%20for%20setpi.gif" style="float: left" width="559" height="372"></p>

<p>Distinguishing the anion of p-hydroxy N-methyl pyridine from its quinone type 
tautomer.<br>
Ensuring that&nbsp; <i>meso</i>-tetra(<i>para</i>-N-methylpyridinato)-porphyrin 
has the correct charge.</p>
<h4>Worked example of Guanine anion</h4>
<p>Guanine (see top figure) anion can be made by removing a proton from either O<sub>6</sub> 
or N<sub>1</sub>. If the only guide to the electronic structure is the topology, 
then both of the lower figures are valid.&nbsp; If a double bond is made between 
C<sub>6</sub> and O<sub>6</sub> (bottom left figure) then N<sub>3</sub> would have only two valencies used, 
instead of the three valencies expected.&nbsp; This is clearly wrong but it 
follows logically from the presence of the C=O double-bond.&nbsp; In MOPAC, by default, a 
nitrogen atom with a valence other than 3 would be assigned a positive charge.&nbsp;This 
is obviously the wrong charge. 
To prevent this from happening, <tt>SETPI</tt> could be used to define a double 
bond between C<sub>6</sub> and N<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp; If that is done (bottom 
right figure) then all the faults are corrected.&nbsp; C<sub>6</sub> now 
automatically forms a single bond with O<sub>6</sub>, which then automatically 
gets a negative charge, the ring becomes aromatic, and the faulty divalent 
nitrogen becomes trivalent.</p>

<p>Other examples of the use of <TT>SETPI</TT>
in defining the Lewis structure can be seen in the following ARC files::</p>


<p><a href="../PM7_and_PM6-D3H4_accuracy/PM7_PDB/1-Myoglobin%20(1M6C).arc">
1-Myoglobin (1M6C)</a> This protein contains a heme ring system, a particularly 
complicated Lewis structure.&nbsp; <a href="CVB.html"><TT>CVB</TT></a> is used to break 
chemical bonds to isolate the porphorin ring from the iron atom, then 
<TT>SETPI</TT> is used to lock the &pi;-system so that the charge on the ring is 
correct.</p>


<p><a href="../PM7_and_PM6-D3H4_accuracy/PM7_PDB/Human%20MTH1%20(3ZR0).arc">
Human MTH1 (3ZR0)</a> More &pi;-bonds than necessary were used in defining the 
Lewis structure for the benzimidazole.&nbsp; Only one is really necessary, but 
extra &#960;-bonds don't cause problems.</p>
