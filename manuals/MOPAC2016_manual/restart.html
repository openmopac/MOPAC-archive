<TT>RESTART</TT>

        When a job has been stopped, for whatever reason,  and  intermediate
   results  have  been  stored, then the calculation can be restarted at the
   point where it stopped by specifying <TT>RESTART</TT>.  The most common cause of a
   job  stopping  before  completion is its exceeding the time allocated.  A
   saddle-point calculation has no restart, but  the  output  file  contains
   information  which  can  easily  be  used to start the calculation from a
   point near to where it stopped.
<p>The restart file contains all the geometry data: current geometry, cycle 
number, gradient and Hessian information, if calculated, etc.&nbsp; It does not 
contain information on the atoms, so the restart data set has to have a normal 
geometry just like a non-restart data set.&nbsp; This is used only for supplying 
the atom-types and number of atoms..&nbsp; </p>
<p>Example: If the following data set is run, it will stop after three geometry
optimization cycles, and output a message indicating that restart files have
been created.</p>
<p>cycles=3<br>

H 1.0 1 109 1 120 1 3 2 1<br>
H 1.0 1 109 1 240 1 3 2 1</p>
<p>By adding the word &quot;RESTART&quot; to the original data set, and re-submitting the
job, the calculation can be continued.&nbsp; In this example, &quot;cycles=3&quot; has
been deleted; this allows the job to run to completion.<br>

<P>
It is not necessary to change the geometric data to reflect the  new
   geometry, although this can be done, if desired.
When <TT>RESTART</TT> is used, the &lt;file&gt;.res file contains all the geometric data, and 
this will immediately over-write the geometry supplied by the data set.&nbsp; 
Note, however, that the data set must have a geometry because the &lt;file&gt;.res file 
does not contain the atom types. A convenient way to monitor a  long  run  is  to  specify  <TT>
<a href="one_scf.html">1SCF</a></TT>  and
   <TT>RESTART</TT>; this will give a normal output file at very little cost.
<P>
Note:  Two restarts exist in the IRC calculation.  If an  IRC
   calculation  stops  while in the FORCE calculation, then a normal restart
   can be done.  If the job stops while doing  the  IRC  calculation  itself
   then  the keyword <TT><a href="irc.html">IRC=<I>n</I></a></TT> should be changed to <TT>
<a href="irc0.html">IRC</a></TT>, or it can be omitted if
   <TT><a href="drc0.html">DRC</a></TT> is also specified.  The absence of  the  string  "<TT>IRC=</TT>"  is  used  to
   indicate  that  the  <TT>FORCE</TT>  calculation  was completed before the restart
   files were written.
