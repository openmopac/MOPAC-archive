<H2>Multiple structures</H2>
<P>
Several structures can be run in one job.&nbsp; To do this, construct MOPAC 
data-sets for each structure, then join all the data-sets together to make a new 
MOPAC data-set that contains all of the structures.&nbsp; Each structure 
(individual MOPAC data-set) should be separated from the next structure by a 
blank line.<P>
Warnings:<P>
*
If any of the individual MOPAC data-sets 
uses <a href="external.html"><tt>EXTERNAL</tt></a> to change the values of parameters for a method, all 
subsequent structures that use that method will also be affected.<P>
*
Avoid using keyword <tt><a href="geo_dat.html">GEO_DAT</a></tt>.&nbsp; When <tt>GEO_DAT</tt> is present, the input file has 
to be re-read.&nbsp; This causes problems when the job has more than one 
structure.<P>
