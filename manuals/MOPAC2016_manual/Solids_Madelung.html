</H2>
The number of diatomic interactions in molecules is finite, being
(<I>N</I>(<I>N</I>+1))/2 in number, where <I>N</I> is the number of atoms.  Solids, on the other hand, have
potentially an almost infinite number of diatomic  interactions.  In order to
reduce this enormous number of interactions to a manageable amount,
approximations are necessary.
<P>
Quantum effects arising from the overlaps of atomic orbitals can extend to a
distance of a few tens of &Aring;ngstroms.  However, the overlaps themselves
become negligible at distances of only a few &Aring;ngstroms.  Overlap integrals
decrease in value at large distances in proportion to the inverse exponential
of  their orbital exponents.  Because of this fact, all overlap integrals
involving atoms separated by more than a specified distance can be ignored.  In
practice, a limit of 5-7&Aring; should be used. <A NAME="BM18250">&#160;</A> One advantage of limiting overlap integrals is that the calculation
runs much faster.  A diamond calculation involving 64 carbon atoms took 31
minutes to do one SCF calculation.  When overlaps involving atoms separated by
more than 7 &Aring;ngstroms were ignored, the calculation took less than 3
minutes.
<P>
Electrostatic terms are more difficult to approximate.  Unlike quantum effects,
electrostatic terms remain significant even at quite large distances, say
several tens of &Aring;ngstroms.  Simply ignoring all terms beyond a specific
distance results in large errors.  Consider a simple two-dimensional ionic
lattice consisting of alternating positive and negative charges in a square
array (Figure).  Each positive ion is surrounded at a distance
<I>r</I> by
four negative ions, and at a distance 2<sup>1/2</sup>r
by four positive ions.  If
all electrostatic interactions at distances greater than a preset value are
ignored, then each positive ion will experience an electrostatic field due to 4
or 8 more or less positive ions than negative ions.  Consider first the effect
of 4 excess positive ions.  Because of electrostatic repulsion, these ions
would raise the energy of the ion by 1328/<I>R</I> kcal/mol, where <I>R</I> was the
cutoff-distance for electrostatic interactions.  Similarly, if there were 4
excess negative ions, each positive ion would be stabilized by 1328/<I>R</I> kcal/mol.
Even for large <I>R</I>, say 20 &Aring;ngstroms, the effect would amount to
many tens of kcal/mol.
<P>
One option would be to include all interactions in a finite set of  fundamental
unit cells.  Since each unit cell is, by definition,  electrically neutral,
this would result in each ion experiencing a field arising from all other
ions.  The sum of the charges on all the ions each ion would experience would
be simply equal to the negative of the ion's own charge.  Consider a cell
consisting of 2A(+).2B(-), in which the four ions form a square with
alternating charges, e.g. A(+)-B(-)-A(+)-B(-).  If 9 cells, forming a 3 by 3
grid, were used to represent the solid, then ion A(+) would experience the
environment of 17 A(+) ions and 18 B(-) ions. This is similar to the situation
which occurs in a molecule.

This approximation is acceptable for polymer systems, but it  can induce a
small error in the symmetry of the electric field in a two-dimensional
system.   Consider the electric field on the ions A(+) and B(-) in our system.
Each ion would experience an electrostatic environment which did not have
square symmetry.  To see this, consider the number of B(-) ions the A(+) ion
would interact with, 18 in all.  It is clearly impossible to position 18 B(-)
ions in such a way as to yield a potential having square symmetry at ion A(+).
<P>
For a three dimensional system, the problem is much more serious.  For a unit
cell consisting of A(+)-B(-), every "A" ion would experience a highly
asymmetric  potential.  Increasing the number of unit cells involved does not
solve the problem--with increasing numbers of unit cells, the effects arising
from distant ions becomes less, but the number of distant ions increases. Put
another way, the influence of an ion falls off as <I>r</I><SUP>-2</SUP>, but the number  of
such ions increases as <I>r</I><SUP>2</SUP>.  This phenomenon is peculiar to 3-D systems.
<P>
To correct this error in the symmetry of the potential, a new approximation is
needed, in which the environment of each ion has the  correct symmetry. In
addition to having the correct symmetry, the function must  have a continuous
first derivative, in order for the derivatives to be calculable.

A cutof distance is selected, this is called <TT><a href="cutofp.html">CUTOFP</a></TT>; by default this is
set at 30 &Aring;ngstroms.  The electrostatic terms arising from all atoms up to
2/3<I>CUTOFP</I> are treated as normal.  Between 2/3<I>CUTOFP</I> and 4/3<I>CUTOFP</I>, the
apparent distance of the atom is reduced, and for atoms separated by more than
<I>CUTOFP</I>, the apparent distance is set to <I>CUTOFP</I>.  These three domains can be
summarized as follows:

Inspection of this function  shows that in the region of
<I>R</I>=(2/3)<I>CUTOFP</I>, the
function value is
(2/3)<I>CUTOFP</I> and the derivative is 1.0.  In the region
<I>R</I>=(4/3)<I>CUTOFP</I> the function has the value <I>CUTOFP</I>, and has a derivative of
zero. In between these two limits, the value of the derivative decreases
smoothly from 1.0 to 0.0.
