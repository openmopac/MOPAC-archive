<p align="left" style="line-height: 1.5" dir="ltr"><font size="4" face="Arial"><u><b>The Problem: </b></u>
Computing the binding energy of a ligand non-covalently 
bound to a protein requires achieving an unusually high accuracy.&nbsp; If 
an entire protein is used then almost always a severe problem is encountered in 
the geometry optimization that prevents such high accuracy from being obtained.&nbsp; 
This problem is a direct consequence of the very large number of local minima on 
the potential energy surface (PES) and is common to all complicated systems such as proteins; 
it has nothing to do with the optimization procedure or with the underlying 
method.&nbsp; When a geometry is optimized, the 
procedure used moves the atomic coordinates in a downhill direction on the PES. 
This process terminates when no further decrease in heat of formation (&Delta;H<sub>f</sub>) 
can be achieved. Minor changes in the starting geometry can give rise to a 
different path being followed, resulting in a different minima being reached. 
These minima can differ in &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> by several kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, and, 
although these minima might look correct, any conclusions drawn from the various &Delta;H<sub>f</sub> 
would almost certainly be untrustworthy.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 1.5" dir="ltr"><u><b>
<font face="Arial" size="4">One</font></b></u><font size="4" face="Arial"><u><b>
Answer: </b></u>If the ligand is non-covalently bound to the protein, and the 
protein is not very flexible, i.e., does not exhibit any allosteric behavior, 
then all of the protein that is far from the ligand can be deleted from the 
system being modeled. If this is done, then most of the minima are automatically 
excluded. </font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 1.5" dir="ltr"><font size="4" face="Arial"><u><b>Implementing 
the solution:</b></u> Starting with a complete system from the PDB or other reliable 
source, the sequence of steps involved in preparing the truncated system are as 
follows.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 1.5" dir="ltr">
  <font size="4" face="Arial">The original 
  system is preconditioned so that it is hydrogenated and any other 
  modifications made that are necessary for the system to be realistic.</font></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 1.5" dir="ltr">
  <font size="4" face="Arial">The system 
  is optimized using PM6-D3H4 or PM7 and an applied small bias of, say, 1 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> &Aring;<sup>-2</sup> 
  towards the starting geometry is added. This step eliminates all the highly local 
  errors in the original structure, without allowing any significant large-scale 
  motions.</font></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 1.5" dir="ltr">
  <font size="4" face="Arial">All residues 
  and small molecules, e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O, that have even one atom within a preset 
  distance of any atom in the ligand are identified and the entire residue or 
  small molecule is included in a new, 
  truncated system. A suitable value for the preset distance is 12 &Aring;ngstroms.&nbsp; At the sites 
  where a peptide bond is cut, hydrogen atoms must be added to satisfy valence 
  requirements.&nbsp; This means that a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen 
  atom in the peptide so it becomes -NH2, and a hydrogen atom is added to the 
  carbonyl carbon in the peptide so it becomes -CHO.&nbsp; In this case, the 
  short chains would have the structure H<sub>2</sub>N-CHR-CO-(NH-CHR-CO)<sub>n</sub>-NH-CHR-CHO, 
  where &quot;R&quot; is an amino-acid side-chain.&nbsp; Any variant that achieves the 
  same objective of satisfying valence requirements would also be acceptable.&nbsp; At 
  this point, the system consists of the ligand, a set of residues from the 
  protein, and a number of small molecules, mostly water molecules, all in a 
  single PDB file.</font></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 1.5" dir="ltr">
  <font size="4" face="Arial">A set of keywords to control the job is now 
  assembled.&nbsp; Essential keywords are:&nbsp; <a href="eps.html">EPS=78.4</a>
  <a href="mozyme.html">MOZYME</a> and optionally 
  <a href="precise.html">PRECISE</a> and <a href="pm6_d3h4.html">PM6-D3H4</a>.&nbsp; Keywords that are useful are 
  <a href="charge.html">CHARGE=n</a> <a href="output.html">OUTPUT</a>
  <a href="html.html">HTML</a> <a href="gnorm.html">GNORM=2</a>.&nbsp; All residues and molecules whose geometries are to be optimized are then defined 
  using a final keyword <a href="opt_label.html">OPT(text)</a>.&nbsp; In this keyword, &quot;text&quot; is replaced 
  with the chain letter and number of each residue that is to be optimized.&nbsp; 
  If a number is unique, the chain letter can be omitted.&nbsp; For example:<br>
  OPT(&quot;401&quot;,&quot;197&quot;,&quot;25&quot;,&quot;41&quot;,&quot;44&quot;,&quot;45&quot;,&quot;49&quot;,&quot;140&quot;,&quot;141&quot;,&quot;142&quot;,&quot;143&quot;,&quot;144&quot;,&quot;145&quot;,&quot;163&quot;, 
  ++<br>
  &quot;165&quot;,&quot;166&quot;,&quot;167&quot;,&quot;168&quot;,&quot;188&quot;,&quot;189&quot;,&quot;190&quot;,&quot;192&quot;,&quot;521&quot;,&quot;537&quot;,&quot;540&quot;,&quot;553&quot;,&quot;558&quot;,&quot;609&quot;, 
  ++<br>
  &quot;610&quot;,&quot;675&quot;,&quot;729&quot;,&quot;792&quot;,&quot;832&quot;,&quot;916&quot;,&quot;933&quot;)<br>
  At this point, the structure consists of a rigid outer shell of residues, 
  containing a flexible region that can be optimized. This flexible region is 
  comprised of sections of protein chain, water and other small molecules, and 
  the ligand in a specific pose. An example of a
  <a href="../PM7_and_PM6-D3H4_accuracy/23H%2030-5/23H%2030-5.mop">data-set</a>, 
  and the resulting
  <a href="../PM7_and_PM6-D3H4_accuracy/23H%2030-5/23H%2030-5.arc">ARC file</a> 
  and <a href="../PM7_and_PM6-D3H4_accuracy/23H%2030-5/23H%2030-5.html">geometry</a> 
  might help to illustrate this procedure.&nbsp; In this example, the starting 
  geometry was already optimized, so the system would run quite quickly.</font></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 1.5" dir="ltr">
  <font face="Arial" size="4">Using a molecular mechanics program such as GOLD, 
  pre-optimize the positions of all atoms that are flagged for optimization by 
  the OPT keyword. This step is necessary; if it is not done then individual 
  water molecules might be badly positioned at the start of the MOPAC job.&nbsp;
  </font></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 1.5" dir="ltr">
  <font size="4" face="Arial">Usually many 
  different ligands and poses are used, so that a large number of jobs need to be 
  run, in which case additional useful keywords are <a href="threads.html">THREADS=1</a>, 
  <a href="dump.html">DUMP=2D</a>.&nbsp; These 
  keywords improve performance when many jobs are run simultaneously in a 
  batch queue.&nbsp; THREADS=1 turns off multi-threading inside MOPAC.&nbsp; 
  When the number of jobs that can be run simultaneously equals the number of 
  threads, each job uses one thread, so the system overhead is almost zero.&nbsp; 
  In the unlikely event of a computer crashing, it is possible to restart 
  individual jobs that were killed by the crash if a <a href="restart.html">RESTART</a> file exists.&nbsp; 
  But doing this involves a tedious operation, and a simpler option is to ignore 
  the RESTART files and just re-run any jobs that were killed.&nbsp; To stop 
  RESTART files from being written, add DUMP=2D.&nbsp; This effectively turns off the safety default two-hour dump.&nbsp; </font></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 1.5" dir="ltr">
  <font size="4" face="Arial">Use macros to construct the jobs and to run them.&nbsp; 
  There is a very high probability of making errors if macros are not used.&nbsp; 
  When writing macros, carefully 
  label the various jobs, both in the job-name and in the job-title. For 
  example, if there are 50 ligands, labeled ligand-1 to ligand-50, and 10 poses 
  for each ligand, then job-names such as L1-5 might be used. This would 
  indicate that the system is Ligand-1 in Pose 5.&nbsp; Try to use short 
  job-names, and use the folder name to specify the survey. </font></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 1.5" dir="ltr">

  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 1.5" dir="ltr">
  <font face="Arial" size="4">Again, use macros to analyze the results.&nbsp; 
  These macros should search the various ARC files to find the heat of formation 
  and, optionally, the gradient norm.</font></li>
