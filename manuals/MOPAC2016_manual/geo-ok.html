<P>Normally the program will stop if certain errors occur.&nbsp; If <TT>GEO-OK</TT> is present, the job will continue, but there is an increased probability that the results will not be meaningful.&nbsp; The errors that are affected are:</P>
<P>If two atoms are within 0.1 &Aring;ngstroms of each other.<BR>
In practice, most jobs that terminate due to these checks contain errors in data, so caution should be exercised if <TT>GEO-OK</TT> is used. </P>
<P>In <TT><a href="mozyme.html">MOZYME</a></TT> calculations, if the supplied charge is incorrect and <TT>GEO-OK</TT> 
is present, it will be replaced by the correct charge, and the calculation 
allowed to continue. In general, this is not a good idea: if a charge is 
supplied, and MOZYME predicts a different charge, examine the system to find out 
which is correct; don't simply assume MOZYME is right!</P>
<P>When <a href="Protein_structure_comparison.html">comparing protein structures</a>, 
a special keyword, <tt>GEO-OK+</tt>, is provided to allow tautomeric hydrogen atoms, 
i.e., hydrogen atoms that are on different atoms in the two structures, to be 
used in the comparison.&nbsp; This is a special case, and should not be used 
routinely. </P>
