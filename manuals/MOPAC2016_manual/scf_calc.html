<P>Once all the integrals needed are calculated, the SCF calculation can be started. A trial density matrix is constructed; this is a diagonal matrix with the diagonal terms chosen so that every atom starts off electrically neutral (except for ions, when each atom is given an equal charge). </P>
<P>Using this trial density matrix, the one-electron matrix, and the two-electron integrals, a trial Fock matrix is constructed. </P>
<P>Diagonalization produces a set of eigenvectors, from which a better density matrix can be made. </P>
<P>This sequence (constructing the density matrix--constructing the Fock matrix--diagonalizing the Fock to get new eigenvectors) is repeated until the density matrix has become self-consistent to within a pre-set limit (<TT>SELCON</TT>). </P>
