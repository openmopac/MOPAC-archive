<h2><A NAME="SECTION00743100000000000000">
 Constraints</A> on geometric parameters in Z-matrices</h2>
<p class="auto-style2">1.
Interatomic distances must be greater than zero.  Zero &Aring;ngstroms
is  acceptable  only  if  the  parameter  is symmetry-related to
    another atom, and is the dependent function.
</p>
<p class="auto-style2">2.
Angles must be in the  range  0.0  to  180.0,  inclusive.   This
    constraint  is for the benefit of the user only; negative angles
    are the result of errors in the construction  of  the  geometry,
    and  angles  greater  than  180  degrees can easily give rise to
    errors in the dihedral angles. </p>
<p class="auto-style2">3.
Dihedral angles must be definable.  If atom <I>i</I> makes a  dihedral with
    atoms <I>j</I>, <I>k</I>, and <I>l</I>, and the three atoms <I>j</I>, <I>k</I>, and <I>l</I> are in a
    straight line, then the dihedral has no definable angle.  During the
    calculation this constraint is checked continuously, and if atoms <I>j</I>, <I>k</I>,
    and <I>l</I> lie within 0.02 &Aring;ngstroms of a straight  line, an attempt will
    be made to re-number the connectivity.  If this fails, the calculation will
    output an error message and then stop. The exceptions to this constraint
    are:
</p>
<p class="auto-style3">(a)
if the angle is 0 or 180 degrees, in which case the dihedral
is not used.
</p>
<p class="auto-style3">(b)
if atoms <I>j</I>, <I>k</I>, and <I>l</I> lie in an  exactly  straight  line
    (usually  the result of a symmetry constraint), as in acetylene,
    acetonitrile, but-2-yne, etc.
</p>
<p class="auto-style2">If the exceptions are used, care must be taken to  ensure  that  the
program  does  not  violate these constraints during any optimizations or
during any calculations of derivatives--see also <TT><a href="force.html">FORCE</a></TT>.
