<a href="mozyme.html"><TT>MOZYME</TT></a> calculations run somewhat faster when some 
overlap integrals are ignored.&nbsp; By 
default, all overlap integrals involving atoms separated by 7.0 &Aring;ngstroms or 
more are ignored. For rough work, such as optimizing a structure that is far from a 
minimum, if <TT>CUTOFS=<i>n.nn</i></TT> is used, then overlap integrals 
involving atoms separated by <em>n.nn</em> Ångstroms or more will be ignored.<p>
A significant increase in speed and reduction in memory can be obtained using
