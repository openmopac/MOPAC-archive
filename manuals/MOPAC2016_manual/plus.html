A '<TT>+</TT>' sign means 'read another line of keywords'.  A '<TT>+</TT>' on line
1 would mean that a second line of keywords should be  read  in.   If that
second line contains a '<TT>+</TT>',  then a third line of keywords will be read
in.  Regardless of whether a second or a third line of keywords is read in, the
next two lines would be description lines.
<P>
Example of '<TT>+</TT>' option
<PRE>RESTART T=4D  OPEN(2,2) SHIFT=20 PM3 +
SCFCRT=1.D-8 DEBUG + ISOTOPE FMAT ECHO singlet ROOT=3
THERMO(300,400,1)
Example of data set with three lines of keywords.
Note:  This and the previous line are the two lines of description.
