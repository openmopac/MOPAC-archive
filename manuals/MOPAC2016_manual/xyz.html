<TT>XYZ</TT> </h1>
<P>Regardless of the coordinate system used in defining the geometry, if <TT>XYZ</TT> is present, then all atoms will be converted to Cartesian coordinates, and the calculation will be run entirely in Cartesian coordinates. </P>
<P>When a system involving several rings, or big rings, is optimized using
internal coordinates, the geometry optimizers often have difficulty.&nbsp; This
is because the effect of a small change in an angle can be a large change in the
interatomic distance of two bonded atoms.&nbsp; This is particularly important
in enzymes and other large molecules.&nbsp; This problem is completely solved if
Cartesian coordinates are used.&nbsp; Therefore, if problems are encountered
with geometry optimizations, particularly if internal coordinates are used,
keyword <TT>XYZ</TT> should be used.</P>
<P>Notes</P>
<ul>
  <li>If&nbsp; <TT>XYZ</TT> is used, the optimization flags are not changed. 
  Therefore, before running a system with&nbsp; <TT>XYZ</TT> all the 
  optimization flags should be set to &quot;1&quot;. For atoms 1, 2, and 3, the 
  optimization flags are forced to 1 if all the other optimization flags are set 
  to 1.&nbsp; To be safe, use <TT>XYZ</TT> with <tt><a href="zero_scf.html">0SCF</a></TT>, then 
  edit the resulting ARC file to delete <TT>XYZ</TT> and set the 
  optimization flags by hand.</li>
  <li>Be very careful if some atoms have optimization flags set to&quot;0&quot;.&nbsp; If 
  the geometry supplied is in internal coordinates, and an atom, say atom 10, 
  has all three optimization flags set to &quot;0&quot;, then that means &quot;Do not change 
  the bond length, angle, and dihedral of atom 10, with reference to the atoms 
  used for the connectivity.&quot;&nbsp; The atom can still move if the atom it is 
  attached to moves.&nbsp; If that atom is converted to Cartesian coordinates, 
  the optimization flags will still be zero, but now the definition changes to 
  &quot;Do not change the Cartesian coordinates of atom 10.&quot;&nbsp; This is very 
  different from the internal coordinate definition.</li>
  <li>Any dummy atoms are automatically deleted if&nbsp; <TT>XYZ</TT> is
  present.&nbsp; Dummy atoms are only meaningful if internal coordinates are
  used.&nbsp; </li>
