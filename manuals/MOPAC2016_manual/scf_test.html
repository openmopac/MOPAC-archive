SCF Test in MOPAC
</h1>
<p align="left">
An exact definition of the SCF test used in MOPAC is not easy to write because 
of the large number of qualifying criteria used, so in the following description 
some details have been left out.&nbsp; For most systems, the SCF criterion can 
be described as follows:</p>
<p align="left">
First, two quantities need to be defined</p>
<p align="left">
SCFCRT: This is the primary quantity used in deciding if a self-consistent field 
exists.&nbsp;&nbsp; For most operations (<a href="one_scf.html"><TT>1SCF</TT></a>, 
geometry optimization, reaction path, etc.) the value of SCFCRT is 10<sup>-4</sup>, but 
for gradient minimization and <a href="force.html"><TT>FORCE</TT></a> calculations a 
higher precision, 10<sup>-7</sup>, is needed.&nbsp; For other calculations, the 
precision can be increased to 10<sup>-6</sup> using <a href="precise.html">
<TT>PRECISE</TT></a>.&nbsp; The value of SCFCRT can also be set using <a href="scfcrt.html">
<TT>SCFCRT</TT></a> or modified using <a href="relscf.html"><TT>RELSCF</TT></a>.&nbsp; The value 
of SCFCRT is a constant in any calculation.</p>
<p align="left">
SELCON: For all &quot;difficult&quot; calculations (<TT>FORCE</TT>, gradient minimization, RHF open 
shell, etc.) SELCON is set to SCFCRT.&nbsp;&nbsp; For normal ground state 
calculations SELCON is set to 100 times SCFCRT and possibly higher depending on 
the gradient.&nbsp; The value of SELCON can vary from one SCF calculation to the 
next.</p>
<p align="left">
For an SCF field to exist, the following test must be passed twice 
consecutively:&nbsp; The change in <span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub> on going from one iteration to the 
next must be less than SELCON kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, and the largest change in density matrix element 
values must be less than&nbsp; 0.05(SELCON)<font face="Times New Roman"><sup>½</sup>.&nbsp;
