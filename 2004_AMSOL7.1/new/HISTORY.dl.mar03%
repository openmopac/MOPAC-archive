               SUMMARY OF MODIFICATIONS, BY DL, mar 03
                       AT START FROM AMSOL6.8
               ----------------------------------------

 I- Bug
 ======
    Attempting geometry optimization with SM5.2R, one gets a message
indicating to use keyword SM5.2. That's a normal answer. BUT...
attempting geometry optimization with SM5.2, one gets
                UNIDENTIFIED AMSOL "MODEL". ABORT.
and the run enters an infinite loop.
+++ Diagnosis #1
    There is no communication of (istop, iwhere) set by LOADIN,
    called by LOADSP (immediate return on istop),
    called by either SMX1 or SRFCTY (no check of istop) !!!!
    called by BORNPL (no check of istop),
    called by ITER or WRITES (no check of istop),
    called by various routines, including COMPFG,
    called by various optimizers,
    called by AMSOL,
    called by MAIN  where the normal message&stop is implemented.
+++ Remedy #1
    Create an "abort routine" STPJOB, and call it immediately
from where istop is flagged on. Don't try to follow the arborescence
up to the main program (much too complicated).
    Modified amsol.compile accordingly.
    Modified LOADIN and MAIN now calling STPJOB.
That's work.

Also, SM5.2 should be a recognized model, with parameters being
those of SM5.2R (in accordance with earlier discussions with Don in 1999).
+++ Diagnosis and remedy #2
    In FINDKY, keyword SM5.2 is recognized, yielding ISM52=1.
    But in READS, one can see the strange statement:
      ELSE IF ((ISM52R.GT.0).OR.(ISM52R.GT.0)) THEN                    PDW1199
    have a laugh and correct:
      ELSE IF ((ISM52R.GT.0).OR.(ISM52.GT.0)) THEN                     DAL0303
That's work.


 II- Gauss-Legendre quadrature never enabled
 ===========================================
   With either SM5.2 or SM5.4R, the GL quadrature is never entered.
+++ Diagnosis
   The flag NINTEG is set to 3 in routine READS.
   The routine EBRGLQ is never called by routine SMX1 called by BORNPL.
+++ Remedy
   In READS, set NINTEG=3 for SM5.4R, SM5.2R and SM5.2, SM5.4A, SM5.4P, SM5.4U
   In SMX1, call EBRGLQ on NINTEG=3.


 III- Existence of the "cusp" problem
 ====================================
   The starting geometry (imine4.dat) is one of those where a "cusp" was
discovered using AMPAC-7.0.
   With AMSOL6.8, no matter the optimizer (EF or TRUSTE), optimization
fails at cycle 1, using analytical gradients and trapezoidal quadrature.
Using GL quadrature, optimization proceeds a bit more, but can't never be
successfully completed.
Using "DERINU", optimization is also never successfully completed.
+++ Remedy
   Implementation in routine DAREAL of mathematical tricks making the
cusps vanish in first and second derivatives of the PES. (Re-use of
preliminary work in AMPAC-7.0).
+++ Results 1
   Hof and details of ENP, GCDS energies agree with AMPAC-7.0,
BUT analytical gradient is wrong.

+++ Diagnosis
   The structure implemented in 1997 for analytical gradients of SM5.x
models has not been pursued: the subroutine SM5HB didn't evolved,
replaced by the new routine SM5RHB... with no gradients.
   In simple words, it is absolutely impossible to optimize geometries
with a SM5.x using AMSOL6.8, no matter the parameters are "R" (rigid
geometries).
+++ Remedy
   Implementation of gradients in SM5RHB; plus various numerical
regularizations already checked in AMPAC-7.0 ...
+++ Results 2
   Optimized hof and details of ENP, GCDS energies agree with AMPAC-7.0,
whoof...


 IV- Other comments: Makefile, element Si
 ========================================

 IV.1- I observe no request for optimization (-O) in the "amsol.compile"
for a linux system. Why?

 IV.2- I never found how to compute SiH4 with some SM5.x models.
Either amsol6.8 complains "AN ATOM TYPE WAS USED WHICH IS INCOMPATIBLE..."
or, using DEV, the run goes into infinite loop. Tried SM5.2, SM5.4A, SM5.4U
Is element Si really implemented and operative?
