Releases 13-16 were commercial software distributed by Stewart Computational Chemistry, which also handled free academic distribution.

Release 17 was a custom version of MOPAC 5 from Prof. Don Truhlar's group at the University of Minnesota,

it released under a slightly different open-source license than the rest of this repository.
